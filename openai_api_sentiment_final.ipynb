              "\"Transcript\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\nSo, OK, you're saying?\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nYeah. So so there's there's two issues that we've seen during our audit work. The first one I wanted to discuss and we got. UM. Yes, the the inventory valuation is the first problem we can discuss. So I'll just, I'll just let you know what we have and then and then you give us your rationale for your number. So we're tracking that you guys were using old inventory. From an old marketing strategy where you're selling to many different retailers, small retailers and whatnot, and that inventory is valued roughly around $504,000. Based on the industry, we know that in reality only about 25% of that inventory can be sold and it's going to be sold for scrap. And so that's about $126,000 and the other 75,000 can't be sold because it's either. It's either too unique to your guys. Product or it has logos on it which you guys don't hold the licensings for anymore and that's that's $378,000 that we're anticipating as being obsolete because there's essentially nothing you can do for there's no longer a. Market for it and you no longer have the license. Sell it. So we're just wondering where where you guys came up with the $97,000 obsolete? Number and and and how we might be able to. Work to get. Closer to to a true obsolete number.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\nOK, our views.\\n\\nSpeaker\\n\\nOK, OK.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\nOhh so based on our experience and knowledge about our industry, so we think for our old inventories there are almost 80% old inventory can be sold in the original cost. But from your view is like the 25% right? So that's the big difference. And from this percentage we calculate, we calculate our inventory, we found there should be around 100,000 inventory. Cannot be sold in in the original cost. So we decide just right of like 97,000 I guess, OK.\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nSo I don't want to. Break character here and I know you guys received. Different information then. Than I did here, but what I mean where? Where do you think the big disconnect is from? From my 25% number to your 80% number? By 25% number comes from our partner or our manager. If you give me a second, I can try to find exactly who it is, who has knowledge of the industry.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\nOver 80% is coming from. Our controller and the President. They also have much experience in this industry.\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nOK. Do you guys have any data that shows how the how the inventory has moved over the last year? Since you've since you've moved to the new marketing strategy, how has your old inventory moved? Do you know?\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\nWe just have the percent of our old inventory. We just have the percent number.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\nWe only have the percentage number, but we don't have the actual like the detail about our inventory, how the inventory flows, we don't have that.\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nOK, well it seems that when we were doing our audit, we discovered that much of the inventory from the prior year still remained in the way. House. And then when we asked for a report showing slow moving inventory, we found out that your accounting system could not actually adequately track inventory and thus you weren't able to provide an agent analysis on the slow moving inventory. It seems like I mean your controller could definitely be correct, but it seems like it would be a large. Leap of faith to just assume that the inventory is is moving or is going to move when when the systems aren't in place to adequately track the inventory. But when we actually do a physical count in the warehouse, most of it is still in there from last year. So if that's the case, would you would you reason that that perhaps the the true number is closer to 25% than the 80? Percent or?\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\nThe last year we didn't. Change our strategy yet? Right, so we can after we change our strategy, the other inventory? We could just sell those order inventory as scrap, right? So but before that, they just sell as like regular inventory or like regular goods, right? So we cannot use that to judge it as. All right.\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nCan you say that again? I'm sorry, I didn't. I didn't get.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\nSo like you just said, like the 25% of our old inventory can say US scrap, right?\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nYeah, that's just. But that's just 25%. Of the old inventory, not of total inventory.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\nYeah, yeah, we. But before we change the strategy, this inventory are sold as like regular inventory, right? Yeah, we cannot use that way to judge the old inventory. Use the last year's. Right.\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nWell, well, we're trying to judge the old inventory right now, right. And so we know that. That the affiliate that your GUYS'S affiliate. Has has been not very profitable at all. It's really been struggling and that's why you guys brought in the new CEO and CFO, it looks like. To to try to change marketing strategies and that's when you guys shifted to a more of a distributor to to the four large retailers. So in doing so, you had you. Had all those products about $504,000 worth of products. In which you were no. Longer selling to your small retailers or you were you were still trying to sell them? Again, they're they're not moving and they're still in the warehouse and. You guys don't control the licensing agreements for the logos that are on nearly 75% of them. So unless unless you guys were thinking about maybe purchasing the licensing agreements again or renewing them we want.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\nThat's our options to do that.\\n\\nSpeaker\\n\\nTo be. OK, what is?\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nWhat does that look like economically, though? Because we can't just. We can't just go off good faith and say hey. They're going to purchase the license agreements and thus the inventory would not be no, would not be absolutely and would be actual sellable. Do you have an actual number?\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\nYou mean the action number which is sellable you mean?\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nYeah. No, like the the number that it would be to to repurchase the licensing agreements or to rework the inventory to make it.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\nActually we don't have. How much do we need to cost to renew the license? We we don't have that number. So in our projects we just estimate the cost.\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nOK, OK. Could you? Could you, which one? Which one is Barry? I'm sorry, we. Probably should want you. OK. And and the other gentleman? Tinio OK. Can can one of you guys explain to me? I guess in complete detail your rationale for for the 80% number like? Some sort of proof that the the inventory is actually moving or that it isn't under an unlicensed.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\nOh, so both our controller and President felt that if they if if he did, did not transform the old inventory, so then at least 80% of the of the old inventory could be sold at, correct. So at about its original cost. That's the only thing you know. It's based on our uh management's experience and knowledge. Yeah. And I think our company also consider about our performance and. Like the income statement, so we don't want other people to judge our financial statement and to show that our company was in a bad situation and our see our President, they think they have the ability to. To sell this 80% of the old inventory. I think it's based on their reputation or something else, but they just think that that is possible.\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nYeah. No. And I I get that. I understand you want to. Put your best foot forward and and and have a financial statement that looks attractive. But it's important that it's also accurate and and faithfully represented, because if it's not, then you have people making resource allocation decisions based off these financial decisions, and it could. It could lead to a lot of very upset people. With lawyers that like to do a lot of work, and that's certainly something that our firm is not. Inclined to deal with or I imagine. JC or CWN as the affiliate so. I wish there was a way we can get a third party evaluation of the of the inventory and not just. Do you guys, do you guys have any? Idea for for. For where you might be able to move the the inventory valuation. Because you can't. You can't be hard on 80%, right?\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\nYou mean the number between or?\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\n25 and 80.\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nI I would be fine with with trying to find a number between 25 and 80 because that's obviously where it's going to have to go, but I don't want to just pick something arbitrarily I'd like. To to to have reasoning behind it, you know.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\nYou have mentioned that our old old inventory is just like staying in our warehouse like for a long time, right? We just want to mention that the old inventory can not sell as like our goods. It doesn't mean that. Cannot sell as crop right scrap, right?\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nWell, from from our analysis, that's where the the 25% came from, we said yes you can sell it as scrap but the other 75% it says that the excuse me. There's my number here. It says the other 75% is is either too too unique to your specific products. So let's say somebody was taking out if someone was going to buy them for scraps, they would need. They would just be getting certain components. From those. But those components are so unique to your product that it wouldn't be it would. It's not like a universal product that's going to fit on somebody else's equipment. So people aren't going to purchase them because they don't. It's not going to work with what they have. And then to go to go to add into that 75%. And I don't have a breakdown between. Which one is which but. The other part of that 75% is that some of them are are enamored with with logos all over them that you guys no longer have the licensing agreements for. So you want to be able to sell them without some sort of legal issues.\\n\\nSpeaker\\n\\nOK.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\nSo so how about? If we buy the new license or or agreement. Is that is that OK? Those things that a good idea or just choose the 25%?\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nYeah, no, if you. If you want if look if you wanna buy licensing agreement. We have to record that purchase. Yeah. And then we can reduce that amount for whatever percentage of inventory that would be covered under the licensing agreements, we can reduce that from from from that 75%.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\nOK.\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nThat I have. So but you guys, didn't you say you don't have you don't have a number on? How much we don't.\\n\\nSpeaker\\n\\nYeah, yeah.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\nHave a number of how much? We need to cost.\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nOK.\\n\\nSpeaker\\n\\nOK.\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nWell, let's see. What? What do you guys think is a good? Number for a license agreement.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\nOr in the sentiment we estimate like 2200 thousand, yeah.\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nTwo be honored and in licensing agreements. OK and.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\nI'm not sure it's that too high because we only have 500, they're only metric, so that's almost like 40% of the inventory value for the license.\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nOK.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\nWhat's your opinion about that?\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nYeah. So if if we sell, if we, if we book 200,000 in in licensing purchases. They just don't say how much of the 75% is is under. Under licensing problems. So what I would say is that 200,000 it seems that seems. Generous. So I would say that we could wipe out at least half of of that 75% number. So now we're looking at. When we're looking at 62 1/2% of the old inventory being sellable, yeah. And then the other 37 1/2 being unsellable, does that does that work for you guys, what that looks like financially is? Is we're looking at 315,000 of the 504,000 of old inventory is good. And that means there would be 189,000. So it's almost, it's still almost doubled the 97,000 that you guys originally had.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\nAlso got like almost 20 actually 200,000 almost.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\nYeah, it's close to it, yeah.\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nIs that something you guys are?\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\nWhat's what's the number? You. Gave us at first at 25%.\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nAt 25%, at 25%, we were looking to be able to capture 126,000 in inventory and actual sellable inventory and half into maybe possibly right off nearly 378,000 in obsolete inventory. So now we're down to only 100.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\nHow much we can?\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nAnd 89,000.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\nBut we also cost like 2-2 hundred 200,000 license fee.\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nYeah. So I'll, I'll, yeah. So we went from.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\nIf in the total.\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nYeah. So we came down 100. And 89. So let me let. Me. Move some more for you because, yeah, you're putting in 200,000 just to get 189. 1000 worth of inventory. So let me let me see so if. We're going to do. So so this is what we can do. Let's let's let's do 2/3. Alright, let's assume licensing agreements covers 2/3 of the old inventory with you guys doing 200,000. To to. Repurchase licensing agree. It's will not that will change the inventory to 75% being sellable and 25% being obsolete, which means you would be able to save 378,000 in inventory and write off 126,000. So or what? That's like 2930 thousand more than than what you guys were originally planning on.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\n.9.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\nCould you repeat the number again?\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nSure, sure. So under under the. The paying 200,000 for new licensing agreements. We're going to look to save 50% of the, the 75% bad inventory. So that brings the total bad or old inventory to 75%, good 25%. That which means that the 25% bad would equal a write off of $126,000.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\nSo we will say almost there.\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nWhich means you're 200,000. Hold on. Your 200,000 investment is is saving you $52,000. Does that sound good to you? Because we're gonna have to move. We've we've only got. About 8 more minutes. To to move.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Span.\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nToo, yeah, yeah. Does that work for you? Guys though the. 126.\\n\\nSpeaker\\n\\nYeah, sure.\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nOK, alright. And so so the next thing is accounts receivable and I'm just going to go much quicker here when I calculated the accounts receivable I was. I was a little. Surprised and disheartened when I when I.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\nYou mean the Table 3?\\n\\nSpeaker\\n\\nRight.\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nWhat's that?\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\nYou you also have that table three, right? The account receivable agent schedule.\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nI do. I do. Have those? Yes. Yeah. So if I'm looking at the, if I'm looking at table three of the accounts receivable aging schedule and I calculate the low range of everything. I'm I'm ending up with a a number of. Of $154,884. So that's at that's at the lowest range of collectibility, the highest our allowance should be is 154 at the highest end of collectibility our our allowance should only be 59,000 and so. You guys are are looking at an allowance right now of of more than double what the lowest range of collectibility and and just for the sake of time to to give you an idea. You're you're. You're reporting that your accounts receivable is 627,480, correct? And your allowance is 435,608. OK, So what this is saying is that 69% or nearly 70% of all your accounts receivables are unlikely to be collected. And and if we're trying to present the most attractive financial statements, this cannot even come close. Do you guys have do? You guys have support for why the number is so high.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\nYou know, after we change the strategy, our our main customer change from like a huge number of small retailers from 4 main retailers, right? You also know that, right?\\n\\nSpeaker\\n\\nYeah, yeah.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\nAnd they uh, it means that they were more like timely for our payments and. Yeah, it means we. Can we could go to, like, fewer rights of for our allowance? Yeah.\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nAre you saying one of one of the? BIG4, you guys have. Abandoned shipper went bankrupt or?\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\nNo other like 4. All all retailers are. Doing good then, yeah.\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nOK, well the. The the 37, if you were to combine all 37 of the old customers. We're talking about. We're talking about $75,000 in total accounts receivable over those 37 customers. So that's still. Doesn't begin to touch where the 400 and what is it? 435,000 comes from?\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\nSo what's your what's? Your suggestion about the reduction of allowance for debt for accounts.\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nWell, the numbers I came up with were both at the low range and in. The higher range. And then I just did one in the middle.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\nYou pick the the OR not the lowest percent. You you choose the middle percent.\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nYeah, well, but still my number is like drastically different than yours.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\nYes. So what's her number?\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nSo my number my my number for the the lowest range of collectibility if if everything went terrible and the zombie apocalypse was about to break out tomorrow, your highest allowance for doubtful accounts would be 154884. At the at the really really low range or I mean high range of collectibility, it's about 60,000. And in the. Middle in the middle, we're talking about 108,107.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\nAlso 60,000 or is the highest one.\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nYeah, that means if if all if the majority of your customers actually end up paying at the highest rate, we know possible.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\nSo could you? Talk to me the medium number again.\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nThe middle, the middle number would be 107 thousand.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\nAnd the lowest is only. 60,000. Right.\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nYeah, yeah.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\nI think the middle person.\\n\\nSpeaker 2\\n\\nYeah, we can save the. Middle middle person.\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nOK, OK. All right. So we'll go with with middle at 1:07. And just to recap, we're going to, we're going to have a 200,000 expense to. To license and agreements, yes. And that's going to allow you guys to only write off 189,000 of of bad inventory. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, not 100 and 89126 thousand. Yeah.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\nThe 25% of the housing.\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nIt was it. Was 100 yeah alright.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\nOh, 100, yeah.\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nI well, I think we're we've got like one minute left. So if you guys have any other questions for me? You guys, you guys from Seattle, yeah.\\n\\nSpeaker\\n\\nAbout you.\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nNo, I'm from upstate New York. Yeah, I just moved to New Jersey to to go. To school. Mm-hmm. But yeah. Alright, it was a pleasure. Gentleman. You guys have my number. So if anything goes wrong or when you whenever you get the the recording uploaded or whatever, just just send me the text or e-mail and let me know where I can download it so I can submit it.\\n\\nSpeaker\\n\\nRead it. OK.\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nAll right. Thanks guys.\\n\\nSpeaker 3\\n\\nThank you. Nice to meet you.\\n\\nauditor\\n\\nYeah, Mike.\\n\\nSpeaker\\n\\nI'm doing.\""

            "Auditor: All right, So what I understand is. We have a inventory valuation issue. And accounts receivable. Allowance for doubtful accounts issues. So doing some research, read the case. Comment came up with three alternatives for you guys, so each with a different effect on net income. So my first alternative was to. Completely call it the loss on the on the the inventory, the obsolete inventory. Now it's going to. Caused a loss of $378,000 so. It was writing off the 97 you intentionally wanted to write off instead of writing off that portion, we just be more conservative. You would just write. Off the whole. Thing and as far as the accounts receivable for that option, we just decreased the allowance for doubtful accounts by 1. By 300,000. So that has actually had a positive. A positive. Effect on your net income. And the way we got that number is. Hold on, just give me. A second.......-0.2732\n",
            "Client: So we use.......0.0\n",
            "Auditor: The the aging table at the end of. The case in order to. Determine that number there. So that was that was where I've been. Been with this conservative option. I I also have.......0.0772\n",
            "Client: Sorry, let me interrupt you. So you said the 300,000 was the most conservative option. So I'm looking at that table now. I have it in front of me and I'm curious how you arrived. At 300,000.......-0.1027\n",

            "Auditor: It was just based on the low. End of. The range it was given to us in the. Case. That's what our auditor. Seemed to be on the low end. So I have two other numbers that I calculated for myself for the for the allowance for double counts. So if you take a look. We're moving on to option two now. If you take a look at. The aging table, right?......-0.4939\n",
            "Client: Now, yeah. Yep.......0.5267\n",
            "Auditor: Get there. OK. I deem the most beneficial right off or the most beneficial for you would be a reduction by 41454 and I got that number. By multiplying it so you see where it says the percentage of accounts receivable being collectible. On the bottom of that. Table I just multiply that number by 90%. So I gained the 90%. You know, you guys being optimistic 90% of your receivables will be collectible using that option.......0.9338\n",
            "Client: So did you do that right? So did you factor in all receivables include from the the under 60 days all the way to the over 120 and you multiplied it by? The 90%.......0.0\n",
            "Auditor: You know, so I just. Did the four 72299 * 90%.......0.0\n",
            "Client: Or and that's what you put in for. Your alternative, as in the allowance for doubtful accounts.......-0.34\n",
            "Client: So it would.......0.0\n",
            "Auditor: It would decrease your allowance for doubtful accounts by. By 401,454. And that was just, in my opinion, a little pushy, you know, because you guys have that issue with you moved from a bunch of small accounts to four large ones, so. It's like you'd. Have to be a little bit more conservative in. That regard. Right. And then as far as the inventory goes, you know I gave you guys on that an option. See, I gave you guys 97,000 that you initially wanted to write off. Now I have a middle ground option here where the loss on the inventory instead of the 97. Or the three. 78 was only 252,000 and I just got that number. I don't know if. You read in the case. And being that only 25% of your inventory was able to be sold. For scrap. So I gave you guys the benefit of the. Benefit of the doubt? Maybe you brought an inventory specialist, or maybe you went to your marketing department and figured out a way to incorporate that new inventory. Into your future product line. So instead of 25% I gave you guys.......0.2666\n",

            "Client: So based on the information we have, we believe about 80% of the old inventory can be sold at scrap and this is if we. This is if. We don't do any investments in renewing, licensing or making the products sellable again, but. With that, with our information, the President, Chris Daniels, he said.......0.0\n",

So you stated that you would have been willing to. Take a ride off around. 252,000. So one of our one of our alternatives is instead of having that big like $500,000 write off where you and your first alternative where you said you wanted to write it all off, we came up with a number of just doubling the 97. 1000 and running off about 194,000 and this is just because based on based on our knowledge of the inventory in the industry, since we believe at least 80% of it could be.......0.7506\n",

            "Client: Sold at scrap, we. Figured at least double this write. Off and kind of. I meet a middle ground with you on that, so if you want to write that down, 194,000 is one of the alternatives. We came up with and that would lead leave us with still positive net income around 50,000.......0.6077\n",
            "Auditor: OK.......0.296\n",
            "Client: And then Zach can talk to you about our our alternative on the allowance. So our allowance for doubtful accounts.......-0.34\n",
            "Client: Was currently 435,000 and because of the new marketing strategy, moving to four larger clients and the case details that they pay in a more timely manner, it's also less to manage than 120. We felt like going forward our last for default accounts should be at least half. So we put 200,000. The plug there. And the reason that is is just because it's less work and you don't have to track down as many payables. So that's really kind of where we thought. Would be good as far as the 200,000 and further and more of a moderate case. If you look at the. The aging table. The receivables that are over 91 days the. I would even consider it immaterial of how much is payable in terms of the the four major customers that are included in the. Marketing strategy. So and really what we're talking about is that other 37 customers, that's both the 11,000 and the 30,000 above those totals. But to reiterate our we believe it should be around 200,000 for our allowance for doubtful accounts going forward.......-0.1531\n",

            "Client: Yeah, yeah.......0.5267\n",
            "Client: And we're willing to negotiate more with the inventory considering we are under a new strategy. So maybe that would be more negotiable with you in terms of maybe going your way a little bit just because of obsolescence. But with the allowance, we're pretty confident that those payables are more reliable.......0.8625\n",
            "Auditor: No, I definitely agree the. You know. It makes sense when you. Take into I didn't take into consideration the size of the different balances. The allowance for doubtful accounts now going forward with the inventory I would. OK, in order for me to feel more confident as the auditor, I would need to see an actual plan, maybe a marketing strategy, maybe something that proves that you plan to actually do something with this obsolete inventory. So I'm, I'm willing, I'm willing to write off the loss at the lowest. 252,000 as opposed to writing off the whole thing at 378.......0.1596\n",

            "Client: Over 5.......0.0\n",
            "Auditor: 100 I believe. 502,000 that was obsolete inventory. So instead of the 25% that you know, our one auditor said he wanted to write. Off to give you 50% of that just. To kind of meet you. Guys in the middle.......-0.296\n",

            "Client: Know. Yeah, totally. The one thing that. How may have mentioned is that our so our Presidents actually approved the plan. To go ahead and. License react license so we can actually sell that inventory. So really in our belief selling for cost is kind of the worst case scenario. If we weren't to go that route. So we feel like even the two writing off that number to eat into that income in that kind of large way would be would represent the like the confidence in our financials that we have. So we although we think 200,000 is above what the 194 we want, we could probably go 200,000 if. That's what you were looking for.......0.8529\n",

We are still considering both plans so. We just, so we just proposed to have $97,000 to to write off 1st.......-0.0644\n",

            "Auditor: The suggestions I was thinking of going back to a more, I guess. Quality standpoint, I was looking at the difference between. So about what from our analytical procedures we've done, we saw that about 25% was looking to be sold, but. Now that you. Stated that about 80% is going to be sold. There's a bit of a difference between those two numbers. Where we came up with about 120. $5000 worth of sold scrap. And about 378,000 of it was going to be for obsolence inventory where you either were going to determine if you wanted to go with different licensing fees. So you can make the item saleable again or ending up. So now you're you're initiative or plan that you have instead of. Kind of taking that whole 378,000 and determining if you want to do the sales on it, you decided that you're going to go with the disposal of it and the company has agreed to the terms. That we're about. 80% of that 504,000. Value is going to be sold at. Its original cost.......0.8885\n",
            "Client: Yes, correct. OK. So about the remaining 20%, we are willing to write it down by seventy $97,000. Yeah, so. So let me kind of rephrase what you said. So from an analytical standpoint, you originally planned to right off our 25% of our inventory, but now as our company has has a third independent third party to purchase our stock. Of those 80%, so, so you're fine. You agree that the entry will be $97.00 did I get you wrong?......0.8434\n",

Just seeing what percentage was uncollectible by that and kind of adding that up and I came to a number of around 100,000, but due to the fact of. The variability of the. 85 to 95% collectibility, I thought a reasonable number would be. Around 200 to 30 three $100,000 for your allowance for doubtful accounts recognition. I would. I just, I haven't done. The procedure for the high end, yet I was going to see if you. Wanted to kind. Of go through that with me real quick, if we. So I took the.

Yes, you and your subordinates to perform a company search to see whether the those BIG4 customers has has some say, legal, like legal issues on repaying debt or whether they have liquidity problem. From our standpoint, they're pretty safe. So I. So that's why we we used it a rather high percentage to it to forecast the allowance for double depth of this year. And you know what, if I use the high percentage of. To forecast those accounts receivable and for over 120 days because 40% has already repaid us in January. So I will use 60% as sorry. Yeah, I will. I would keep using 50% as collectible, so it seems that the amount is around $36,000 and 30. Sorry, $360,000 can be reversed to our. Versus our first, I rephrase it again. So from our evaluation before we think that the reference amounts could be ranged from $37,000 to $400,000. So that's the difference. That is, the $3000 is not that material, especially $3000 does not exceed half percent of revenue.

You can then adjust for the next year. What percentages are more reasonable? I feel like. With the quality standpoint, quality standpoint, it seems that 300,000 is a reasonable.

I mean to to a true and fair feel if it understates our accounts receivable too much. I'm I'm a bit concerned it is to understate our accounts receivable, so.

I feel like we can continue to sort of capitalize on the inventory that we have right now, which would necessarily add or ask for a decline or a an inventory obsolescence write off. So we do agree like maybe maybe there's some items I can't get thrown out, like if it's got logos and such. But we feel like for other items, we might be able to recycle it, maybe reuse it again. So we're at the point where I think we only need to write off. Basically about 97,000.......0.8759\n",

We feel that even if we sell this to scrap, we won't be able to get as much out of it. So we're more inclined to look into the side of maybe even renewing our licensing agreements and then just seeing what we can do from that point. But like I said, our owners and our President just came in. So like we are still trying to figure out what direction we're wanting to go in. And so we feel like to just write off like 300,000 or almost 400 thousand of our inventory, like right away under a new president would be a little like asking too much.......0.9702\n",

It's not necessarily going to be something that just goes out of style and. Necessarily needs to be thrown out or scrapped. So I think to say. That like, just even like. 50% is a little high.

Now selling to four major retailers or four major. Buyers or distributors? And they're going to make up basically the. Bulk of our earnings and our income and basically our accounts receivable. So based off like the last three months performance, they've done exceptionally well as far as being able to collect and we feel like if we're going to be able to reduce our our. Reduction of allowance for doubtful accounts. It would be on the higher side just because that's going to be the main focus of our business. Moving forward, so we're on the higher end of this, we're going to look at about 400,000 that. We should be. Able to collect or reduce on our debt accounts.......0.8423\n",

Your the aging of your receivables has become. The collectibility has gone up. We have seen that. However, we do have that. Being that your new system is is, it's very new and everything's still working out. We're not sure exactly how the probability of collection for receivables over 120 days.......-0.4874\n",
            "Client: OK.......0.296\n",
            "Auditor: So but overall, yes, it is going up and to remain on the conservative side, we our estimate is about 200,000. So about half of what you have.......0.6054\n",
            "Client: Yeah, yeah, I guess. I guess the biggest thing, if you look at our receivables, if you look at our four major buyers, even over 120 days, only two of them had any balance over 120 days and the other two had already been paid off. Out that the two owed was only $7000 in collectability or AR's and all other customers were significantly higher at almost like 80. I think that's like 83 or 4% so. So I mean that's just over 120 days and then you get to like within the other days and we're looking at higher collectibility. I mean, again, we're focusing more on these four major buyers from us and I feel like with the transformation of our business model that our. New president has put. In that it should, we should be able. To collect a lot more on our allowance. For our AR, so we see it as that we should be able to reduce it on the higher side on this.......0.8814\n",
            "Auditor: Iron side, yeah. Yeah, I definitely, we definitely see that going forward. You should be able to collect more. Our main concern is on the customers who the small retailers who you were previously selling to. That's our main concern of why we don't want to go so high. We can go up, maybe a little also. Adjustment would create income and it would be very material and we don't want to. We want to remain conservative, so we can maybe bump that number up to 2 to 5275.......0.8602\n",

            "Client: Yeah, because I mean when our CFO, CEO and Vice President came by and valued our inventory, they thought they could sell it for 80%. So we're thinking, I mean 80 and 42 kind of meet in the middle. At 65.......0.6249\n",
            "Auditor: No, no, no. No, no, I'm sorry. I think I explained that wrong. We're getting you're getting 80, we're getting 25, OK. So the what the? 42 is. Out of the entire inventory, 42% of that is the old inventory.......-0.8579\n",

We're essentially cutting that down almost and well, it's. A little more than half. But again, this is a compromise we're willing to make because we do feel like that we can collect on our accounts receivable, even passed 120 days.

Completely call it the loss on the on the the inventory, the obsolete inventory. Now it's going to. Caused a loss of $378,000 so. It was writing off the 97 you intentionally wanted to write off instead of writing off that portion, we just be more conservative. You would just write. Off the whole.

By multiplying it so you see where it says the percentage of accounts receivable being collectible. On the bottom of that. Table I just multiply that number by 90%. So I gained the 90%. You know, you guys being optimistic 90% of your receivables will be collectible using that option.......0.9338\n",

            "Auditor: It would decrease your allowance for doubtful accounts by. By 401,454. And that was just, in my opinion, a little pushy, you know, because you guys have that issue with you moved from a bunch of small accounts to four large ones, so. It's like you'd. Have to be a little bit more conservative in. That regard. Right. And then as far as the inventory goes, you know I gave you guys on that an option. See, I gave you guys 97,000 that you initially wanted to write off. Now I have a middle ground option here where the loss on the inventory instead of the 97. Or the three. 78 was only 252,000 and I just got that number. I don't know if. You read in the case. And being that only 25% of your inventory was able to be sold. For scrap. So I gave you guys the benefit of the. Benefit of the doubt? Maybe you brought an inventory specialist, or maybe you went to your marketing department and figured out a way to incorporate that new inventory. Into your future product line. So instead of 25% I gave you guys.......0.2666\n",

So one of our one of our alternatives is instead of having that big like $500,000 write off where you and your first alternative where you said you wanted to write it all off, we came up with a number of just doubling the 97. 1000 and running off about 194,000 and this is just because based on based on our knowledge of the inventory in the industry, since we believe at least 80% of it could be.......0.7506\n",

We felt like going forward our last for default accounts should be at least half. So we put 200,000. The plug there. And the reason that is is just because it's less work and you don't have to track down as many payables. So that's really kind of where we thought. Would be good as far as the 200,000 and further and more of a moderate case. If you look at the. The aging table. The receivables that are over 91 days the. I would even consider it immaterial of how much is payable in terms of the the four major customers that are included in the. Marketing strategy. So and really what we're talking about is that other 37 customers, that's both the 11,000 and the 30,000 above those totals.

The allowance for doubtful accounts now going forward with the inventory I would. OK, in order for me to feel more confident as the auditor, I would need to see an actual plan, maybe a marketing strategy, maybe something that proves that you plan to actually do something with this obsolete inventory.

License react license so we can actually sell that inventory. So really in our belief selling for cost is kind of the worst case scenario. If we weren't to go that route. So we feel like even the two writing off that number to eat into that income in that kind of large way would be would represent the like the confidence in our financials that we have.

And I know you guys are trying to sell to a larger market. And so the chances that you'll be able to reuse though that inventory I feel is. Low and based off of the information I have, uh, 25% of the inventory from last year is able to be used again. And so I have a decreased value valuation decrease of actually $378,000 instead of the $96,000. So that's what I was thinking about that.......0.2648\n",

But what we're thinking is we can reach out to our previous clients and see if they're interested in selling it. And we actually feel pretty confident that we can sell at least 80% of the inventory. Which would make us a valuation of 100 and about $100,000. And so the 97, that's optimistic. But we think that might be kind of where we're at just because we understand the industry.......0.9588\n",
            "Auditor: Sell it for that. Well, my worry with that is that you guys didn't, I would say you guys didn't do as well selling the inventory previously with the CWN company. And so I feel like the the old clients that you guys might be looking into might be struggling. As well, so the chances that they will be able to buy the inventory back from you guys is probably not as high as 80 per. So while 80% is the is your estimate, I feel like maybe that estimate is too high, maybe we can negotiate for 60% or something like that.......0.4914\n",

Will admit that. 60% we think would be a good amount just because though we do feel confident we could sell 80%, we do understand that as you were saying you. Know we don't have. A buyer just yet. So we would be willing to go to 60%, which would end us up at about two. 200 for our. Allowance for reduce in market to inventory. Would you feel comfortable with that or?......0.91\n",
            "Auditor: Yes, I I do feel comfortable with that because it does give us the opportunity to lower inventory to an amount I'm comfortable with, but also it also gives you guys the opportunity to look at the like, wait and see and see how the market. Does as well.......0.9331\n",

So maybe to kind of cover that risk, we're thinking having a higher amount just in case one of them doesn't pay, especially with the four major people. One doesn't pay.

            "Client: And the other being receivables.......0.0\n",
            "Client: So our idea. For the inventory is originally not to take a loss because about 42% of our current inventory is old and right now the license we don't hold the licensing agreements and they're issued off to some of our other clients. And and right now, if we did OK, so right now if we want to keep the old inventory, it would require. An an additional. Investment so we could transform it into saleable products or renew into expired licensing agreements. But a third option is to. Sell the inventory like around 80% of the inventory at a scrap at the original cost to reduce our losses. So right now we want to sell the majority of the inventory to the current holders of the licensing agreements because they have viable use for many of the products. And then after that, we would like to sell the remaining inventory as scrap at original cost.......0.9398\n",
            "Auditor: OK, well, according to the market research that we did, we came up at approximately 25% of the old inventory can be sold as scrap. However, the other 75% cannot be recovered, I don't know. We did not know if you can sell it to the holding the people holding the license, right? Now so if you. Do that. How much? How much would you want to write off for inventory?......0.7071\n",

            "Auditor: Well, right now around 504,000 of your inventory is part of the old inventory. So if you sold 25% of it at cost, I don't believe I have. I guess it depends because all the units have different costs. It depends what units you would want to. Sell, yeah. But the other 75% that you can't sell, according to the research that we did, it comes out to around $378,000. That is not, you cannot sell. And I know that it's a lot to write off all at once. So I think we could probably maybe find a compromise of what number you. Do want to write off?......0.4939\n",
            "Client: Certainly. Yeah, I I agree. So on our end, we totally understand. The need I guess for getting off such a large figure. However, given like the CFO's kind of analysis, everything coming back to this $97,000 that the CFO originally had analyzed and come up with, we kind of again have this idea of compromising between those two. Numbers so originally kind of looking back at it, we were told that we actually could sell a lot of our old inventory with the old strategy and everything back to those. To somewhat balance out the cost as well as sell for scrap or for cost directly. So there would no, there wouldn't be any loss and such. So originally again we kind of went with this 97,000 further we kind of did do some more analysis on it with the given information and we actually came up with a second figure. Of around 101,000, certainly it's not anywhere close to where your figure is, but I think between those two numbers certainly would be logical and reasonable.......0.8359\n",
            "Auditor: OK, I would think. Maybe off from our part a little bit higher than around 100,000 just because that is still a little bit low and we don't want to run the risk of like of misstating the financial statements to either the public or the stockholders. So I think going for a number that's a bit higher would be better just to be on the. Safe side. Of things.......0.8121\n",
            "Client: Yeah, we definitely agree with that actually kind of going back to making sure that we're not. We're not kind of overstating or doing any, I guess, fraudulent work. The all of these numbers that we could come up with were very much like number crunching. And so we do get both sides of it. It's just different interpretations of everything. So certainly are we looking at like 100? And like 20. $5000 write off or what? Were you really thinking?......0.9488\n",

            "Auditor: I based my numbers off of the. I'm sorry. One second, let. Me find this. I base the numbers off of the inventory that we had and our assumption that you could not sell more than 25% of it. So we were thinking of instead of writing off the whole 75% that we thought wasn't sellable. We could just write off either 50 or 40% of it, so you're still writing off a lot, but not enough that if you can sell some of it, you can still do that in the coming year.......-0.0387\n",
            "Client: OK. But just to interject, so because we can sell lease? We came up with the 80% estimate that we were able to sell at original cost of scrap just based on like our knowledge of the inventory, the industry and the current market conditions. So based on that I I think we should bring I think we should be able to bring the number down because we have that option. And in addition to having the option of again, I'm just going to bring that up again, selling, selling some of the products to the license holders. So I think that should definitely bring it down. I think it should be below 200,000.......0.9035\n",
            "Auditor: I understand what you're saying and I do think that you might be able to sell a lot more of it than what we were estimating you could sell, but given that you would be selling it in the upcoming year, you never know how the market conditions are going to change or even if the license holders are willing to buy it from you. So I think maybe staying. Closer to 200,000. I'm not saying going over 210,000 even we could stay around like 200,000 might be a little bit safer.......0.7602\n",
            "Client: OK. So kind of just give you a background. If we do enter in the 200,000 figure as the the net loss, we would actually come up with a net income of around $43,000. In which case that certainly affects affects how affects how, how public trading and our shareholders and stockholders. In which case we we're kind of trying to stay away from such a low figure. Certainly we do understand that where you're coming from as well. So we are hoping to get around. Kind of trying to number crunch off the top of my head between your given value and our given value of what we can do with the Duke cost. We are looking around like 180,000 would be like I think kind of a a good estimate to kind of go forward given that we are putting in probably another 80,000. On our end to make sure that it does align with the values and I guess the transparency that you're trying to.......0.975\n",
            "Auditor: I understand that absolutely we decided those weeks cannot go lower than $200,000. Because it would affect. The materiality and the mistake statements of the of the statement. So we don't want to do that. We want to keep it at the lowest $200,000. We will not be able to go lower. Than that so. I don't know if you guys are willing. To go a little. Bit higher and compromise.......-0.4931\n",
            "Client: Give us a second. OK. So we do understand that it is considered. However, I when you're really looking at the spectrum I guess of materiality, there are variances. I think when you were looking at this specific materiality, it's definitely on the lower end of the spectrum rather than high. Would you agree with that?......0.7125\n",
            "Auditor: I guess it is on the lower spectrum.......-0.296\n",
            "Client: Well, because I kind of given the information, we kind of looked at. The I guess the percentage in which case we're dealing with, so to begin with, the college where novelties or CWN is only really 20% of brings up 20% of the revenues of the total entity and within that 42% of that. Is what like we're dealing with in regards to like the old strategy. So kind of taking like basing that off the numbers we were given. And so, granted again, that it is material, but it's not necessarily as significant as let's say. Another company where its impact is much larger since again we are only or the CWN is only 20% of.......0.5747\n",
            "Client: It, and we also recently implement implemented a different product marketing strategy, so that would impact our inventory and our accounts receivable as well. So is there any? Way that you could. You could give us some. Leniency, especially in regards to this new marketing strategy, is something else that we did previously. We had what 120 small retailers and and that really impacted us because they weren't. Our accounts receivable turnover was low. But now we with the new marketing strategy, we switched to four larger retailers and their payments are more on time, more dependable. So our turnover is is expected to go up and make things more more consistent. So that would impact us in a good way as well.......0.7579\n",
            "Client: So we again kind of looking at that with the, I guess this year this transition year, certainly this balance will be off, but we do project that further years we won't have to deal with this inventory issue. Therefore again kind of lowering the standard that materiality because it's not going to be as significant as we do transition to this new. So again, kind of coming back to that figure, are you, you're not willing to go below 200,000?......-0.0102\n",
            "Auditor: I guess if we would have to. Go over to. I don't want to go too much. Under 200,000. Just because of the problem, so maybe around 190. For I don't know if 190 would. Work for you guys.......-0.4445\n",
            "Client: If we put 190 into the into kind of our basis, we do come up with a net income of $50,000 around $50,000. Yeah, I mean that would work for us. 190 would be a very reasonable area where both there's this compromise between the two. So yeah, do you want to settle on one?......0.6115\n",
            "Auditor: 90 then we can settle on 190 and just keeping in mind that next year, depending on how much can be sold.......0.0\n",

            "Client: For sure, I definitely agree with that. I think again depending on how our new strategy goes, whether or not that'll work and if it doesn't work, then again, we'll revisit this and make sure that. We do side with the side of leniency to make sure that everything is properly stated. Yes. And then the second part of kind of with this new transition is dealing with receivables. So on our end, we do have some information in which case I don't believe was really stated for you. Actually, do you want?......0.9201\n",
            "Client: To. OK, so like I mentioned before, we still the 120 smaller retailers. On and over the years, so our allowance for doubtful accounts has gone up, but because we switched to the larger retailers, we think we should be able to reduce our allowance for doubtful accounts, especially because again the payments are more consistent and dependable. So our plan is to write off or on. Sorry. Yeah. Our plan is to. Reduce the the allowance for doubtful accounts by 400,000. Because we know our current unaudited amount is 450,000 for this year. So obviously we'd want to bring that down to 50,000. And then in terms of the journal entries, we want to credit other revenue. So let's see where is it?......0.5615\n",
            "Client: Yeah. So kind of going off that again with this information given and with this new transition, we do have much more faith that our receivables will be collected and therefore, would it have to deal with such a long receivable day turnover. So again with this. With this figure, we came up with 400,000. On your end, what did you end up calculating?......0.6478\n",
            "Auditor: We had come up with around, I think for receivables it was 300,000. So I think 400 anywhere between 300 and 400 would be reasonable because I do think that you there is space to reduce the account.......0.0\n",
            "Client: Yes. So yeah. So on our end kind of reassuring that going from 120, I guess. Customers to for really helps us and especially with the floor being such large companies that there is a good track record and they would be very good at I guess providing their payment are in on your end. Did you have any kind of concerns with the way that the fork retail? Companies are going about their payments and stuff.......0.9359\n",
            "Auditor: We did see that you have been increasing over the years and we do believe that there is room to decrease the allowance for doubtful accounts. However, we didn't want to reduce it by more than 300,000 just because like we said, it is a new strategy. You never know some problems might occur and you don't want. For allowing St. outflow accounts to be too low. But then you run into some problems and you don't. Have enough? Whatever reserve. So I think maybe not 400 might be a little bit too high. So think of maybe going a little. Bit lower than that. Just to be on. The safe side, I agree.......0.8182\n",
            "Client: With that actually. Yeah. So then again kind of going back, we totally understand with this new strategy, this new risk, how we're converting. So we were possibly thinking of maybe 375 due to the fact that again with this new strategy going into going into this new market. And like how we're going and approaching this thing that that would be kind of a good balance leaving. 75,000 with allowance for doubtful accounts, just in case if something happens, we do have that 75,000 as a backbone. And again, with these four retailers, we do have confidence as they are very large that we won't be kind of scrapped and we'll be prepared.......0.791\n",
            "Client: Because in addition, we're also expecting fewer write offs and then we're also expecting our collectibility to increase. So then that will give us more of a cushion.......0.3182\n",

            "Client: UM. I think with our given information. 350 might be a little too lenient, I would suppose because of the fact that I think we I think I mean given the information that we have, we're pretty confident on what we're doing and especially having the cushion of those two. So possibly or having the cushion of the four big industries, so possibly spending. I don't know an average between 3:50 and 375. Would you? Would you feel comfortable with a number like? I don't know 360-5370.......0.9285\n",

            "Auditor: Yeah, I mean, I can start, I mean from what I read from the case, I think it's really two issues, right. So the the first issue is with inventory like you just mentioned, Alisa with the obsolescence. So from what it looks like. I'm trying to find. The so I'm sorry. Give me one second. So there was a, you guys, there was a proposed adjusting right off for $97,000 to loss to the markets kind of inventory. And then again allowance to reduce inventory to market. So the feeling of. The order is that that amount is too low.......0.4588\n",

            "Auditor: Correct. So the the aspect of the orders that well there needs to be a much higher number due to obsolescence and inventory. That's the first issue. And the second issue is a little bit more vague on our end is with the agent. With not receivable. From our perspective, you know we're, I know that it's the case says that there's a. There are a lot of. New customers to. This for this organization, so it's kind of hard to determine. Whether those whether those. Whether those accounts are going to be paid in full and things like that because you know with new customers, you're not sure if you know what their credit worthiness is like and you know you're you're not sure if they'll pay off. So I think the issue with that as well is you know how should how should the receivables be aged and how should they be written off. So those are the two issues that from the owner perspective that we have. We have an issue.......0.6862\n",

I know this says that there's, you know, this percent collectible based on past years collection history and percent collectible based on fourth quarter 2000 collection history. Right off the bat, I don't think using. And collectible based on fourth quarter 2000 collection history is the smartest way to go about it.

So the problem with you know, as you guys know, the problem with conceivable is you never, it's always an estimate. So you never know what the actual amount being written off is because you make the. Estimate so percent based on past year collection history I feel is a better percentage to use than just the percent 2000. OK, so that's that's the calculation I used. I used the average. If you look at this is like 70 to 90% collectible. So I just used the average for each range and calculate that based on the accounts, OK and then that's how I got the 278,000.......0.7586\n",

Have we're dealing with an inventory and allowance for doubtful account reduction? And I guess we can present. What we're thinking after doing our evaluations and analysis of our inventory as well.

And then I did our own tests on that to like value what we could like sell or have to write off and then that's how we came up with that. 97,000 number.......0.9802\n",

            "Client: And one reason why we want to keep it at that level is because we do have plans to explore. Licensing, which would provide the opportunity to sell. The remaining old inventory, because it would be updated. We also did evaluations that determined we can sell this material for scrap close to original price as well. So in order not to lose out on revenue there, we think that our evaluation of 97,000 is the best. Way to write it down.......0.9367\n",

            "Client: I'll just I'll continue with allowance for doubtful accounts to kind of match with that and then we can see what your thoughts are for the last for doubtful accounts since we've moved different marketing strategies, we now are using four major retailers and. Rather than oh are like 120 small retailers that. We're increasing our receivables and since we believe that these four retailers in the past in the fourth quarter of the last year. We're so good our receivables have been improving and therefore as you can see in the tables with our aging receivable in. Table one or sorry not table one. Table three, it showcases high percentage in table. Three of collectibles. So we're in say under 60 days, 61 and 90, we're in high 85 to 95% collectible.

And what we know about the mark, what we know about the industry was that as you said, 42% of that 1.2 million, which is a total of 505 hundred and 4000. We estimated that approximately 25% of this amount of the old inventory could be sold as scrap or about at its original Co. And then the other 75% of the dollar value could not be recovered. So 75% of the 504,000 which we calculated as $378,000 total was the amount that we considered should be the more appropriate amount to write off instead of that. 97,001 of the other issues we had, what one of the other reasons for that was the fact that. Just give me one second. I'm working on that. So basically that, I mean, did that make sense to you what I said about the the fact that about 25% of that could be resold and then the the way that I got the calculation was that clear enough?......0.9356\n",
            "Client: Yeah. So it's 25, can be sold and then 75% can't be.......0.296\n",
            "Auditor: Also considering right and then also considering the expired because some of those old, some of the old catalog, the old inventory was kind of tied to those expired licensing agreements. So that those would kind of just end up being some cost and that's one of the reasons why we we considered that 75% of the 504.......0.2732\n",
            "Client: OK.......0.296\n",
            "Auditor: Problem would not be all saleable. So our amount was 3, the amount we came up to was 378,000 for the for the reduction to the inventory or the obsolete inventory instead of that 97,000. So it would be a larger increase. The 400,000 for allowance for download. Balance is actually more than I had. We had considered. We were considering on the on the higher sorry on the low end of that of the percent collectible. So what we were what we considered was 200 to 300. Reducing the allowance for doubtful accounts, so the 400 is more or less, you know that's in the same direction that we were considering. So the only difference right now I think would be the, the, the major difference would be sorry the of the obsolete inventory amount, the amount to write off.......-0.836\n",
            "Client: OK, so going off just with the allowance for doubtful accounts, it seems like we're kind of on a similar footing with that. Would you be? Comfortable with, if we agreed upon 300,000 for a reduction allowance for doubtful accounts. OK so.......0.8388\n",
            "Auditor: 300,000 would be adequate, yes.......0.5574\n",

            "Client: That old inventory is kind of tied to having a license to sell that or even, you know, make something of it. So. And our President had in. Is interested in renewing those licenses just so we can sell them, but I understand that you guys have done your own independent tests of the the inventory and you guys do have great industry knowledge about that. But I was. Interested in knowing since we are considering these renewal and licenses, maybe not going for 7075% of the obsolescence and more of like 60%.......0.9405\n",

            "Auditor: Absolutely. I was just looking over one more note and I just want to see if I can remember what it was that I wanted to mention about this before we move forward. But I I'm on the same page with you, the 60% is more than fair. OK, I'm actually just looking at I'm I'm assuming you had a similar portion of the assignment where you had an Excel spreadsheet and then you were supposed to recast. Is that done right? OK, so I'm just looking at my cell here and I just wanted to just look at the numbers one time.......0.9525\n",
            "Client: OK.......0.296\n",
            "Auditor: OK. So yeah, obviously you know the. The reduction or this obsolete this write off for the inventory is going to decrease. You know the the income at least for the portion of the income statement. That 97,000 still actually gave you, I think with the $97,000 right off, I think they're still showing a profit, but the you know up to I think 300 up to the 60% amount that we that we. We just wanted to, you know, I'm just going over the fact that, you know, the income, you know, it's the reported income, might be, you know, not represented properly by a lower number. So I I I appreciate the 60% amount and. 300,300 and 2400 write off for that obsolete inventory is is definitely agreeable on our end.......0.8609\n",

            "Client: OK, we're recording. OK, so we're college where novelties, a subsidiary of Johnson's Capital Corporation. Our revenues count for 20% of our parent companies. We began as a manufacturing company. We've kind of been a financial drain on our parent company. In September of 2000, we got a new president. His name is Chris Daniels and he initiated a new marketing strategy. So we're now an importer and distributor of products to a few major retailers. Our sales have. Still been poor? Our inventory has built up to $1.2 million and 504. 1000 of that is belonging to old products, mostly clock parts, which would require additional investment and some new licensing agreements. If we wanted to sell them your company XYZ started performing substantive tests of inventory in late Nov. Number of 2000 our accounting system couldn't adequately track inventory or provide analysis on the slow moving inventory and inventory was a material account. So your companies VP, COO and CFO went to our warehouse to identify obsolete inventory. An estimate a write off of inventory. So the two main issues we're going to talk about today are accounts receivable and inventory. All right, you anything to add to that?......0.5149\n",

            "Client: So our first recommendation is a 97,000 write off of obsolete inventory and that was from the accounts from the Vice President, the CEO and the CFO. And another issue we wanted to address was the write off of or the reduction of accounts or allowance for doubtful account. Months and our first proposal would be a reduction of $400,000 to that account because we are more optimistic about the new retailers we have under the new. Marketing strategy this year.......-0.2516\n",

So we would have an increase in other revenue of 325,000. 600 just from selling that to other companies.......0.8945\n",
            "Auditor: OK, right. Yeah. So I was, I was right. I was reading all right. So basically from our evaluation techniques, we can close that 42% of the 1.2 million of inventory is old, so. His answer was up for the. Old marketing strategy. So it's technically absolute. So 25%, which is around 126,000 maybe so for scrap and then the a 75% of that is basically things that are kind of like unique that can't be resold unless you invest more money and effort into production and licensing fees. So that will be. Extra expenses on that part. So that 75% equates to $378,000. So I was thinking if. We don't want to write off. $378,000 by disclosing. It we could. Perhaps go back into the licensing fees and then try to resell. It with the new marketing strategy.......0.7284\n",
            "Client: Oh, you want to go? Oh, OK. So what about the possibility of the writing off of the 97,000? And then for the rest of the? OK. So the 97 we would thousand we would write off is from the old marketing strategy. So the old, more obsolete inventory of us with 407,000 that our company is proposing we can sell for. And so we would have a increase in other revenue of that 325,600. And then the remaining between the 407 and the 325 that could also be written off in addition to the 97,000. That way we don't have to spend money on license agreements just to try and sell it. We can just get rid of it without having to, like directly write it off.......0.7582\n",

            "Auditor: OK.......0.296\n",
            "Client: OK. So we'll have a write off of approximately $175, sorry, $175,000. Sure, 178. And then we would have an increase in other revenue of 325,600. Just based off of what we're selling for scrap.......0.7378\n",

So that's the $504,000 when you take the $97,000 of obsolete inventory out of that, you're left with $407,000. That we were hoping to sell. So and you and we were hoping to sell them at 80% of the original cost. So when you multiply 80% by $407,000, we would be left with 325,000 and $600.......0.8834\n",

That which is 120. 6000 can be sold, so that would. Be your other revenue. And then 75% would be kind of obsolete unless you rework it. So if we subtract 97,000 from 378. Let me see. How that works? You kind of follow me or no. That would be $201,000. That we could, perhaps. Incorporate into the new marketing strategy.......-0.6115\n",

We're trying to stay away from trying to relicense some of that old inventory just because we're really focusing on the new strategy and like our new. So going back into that old inventory and paying more to license it for something that we're we're not even really going to be pursuing isn't something that management is not really interested in. So that's why we're trying to take a bigger chunk of it. The 80% of the old inventory, less than 97,000 write off and sell that. For 80% of scrap or sorry of cost. So we would still have a write off of the 178,000 and. Then we would. Get to sell off some of the rest of that old inventory, so we would still have some other revenue.

Reduce that account by 400,000 and that's through our controllers judgement assessment just due to the collectability is going to increase because we now have only four major clients that retailers that we sell to. So we don't have to they're way more timely and reliable.......0.86\n",

A lower range and I kind of come up with a lower number, so basically deem as uncollectable. Less of allowance. I was thinking of lowering it by 200,000. Well, I mean if you guys want to lower. By more because the. The new stores are more. The the lion more reliable, I would say than I'm perfectly fine with that too.......0.7378\n",

That number is 400,000 or sorry 407,000 and then we're going to sell that for scrap at 80% of its original cost. Which is 325,600. Now we're going to take the difference between the 407,000 and the 325,600, which is the one 78400. And that'll be our total write.

            "Client: Yes. Alright. So based on the inventory numbers, what were you thinking was an appropriate inventory obsolescence number?......0.6124\n",
            "Auditor: So what I've come up with is you guys have. By my estimation, approximately $504,000 of inventory that is. Either add or nearing an obsolescence issue. Of that, approximately 75%, as far as I can tell, is in its current status unsaleable without either reworking or you guys relicensing. Claim to have your inventory license to make it sellable again, that the number I came up with was $378,000. So short of evidence that you guys have either planned on reworking it and making an investment in reworking this inventory or re upping. The licensing agreement I think that three, $378,000 would be an appropriate number to write off to put into. The loss due to market decline, if you guys can present any type of evidence you know to the contrary, then I would certainly be open to negotiations on where we should ultimately come up to with.......0.5994\n",
            "Client: That number so, but we also came up with the number of 500. And $4000 of. Old inventory and like you already previously. Noted, we would have to refinance or restructure the majority of that inventory in. Order to just. However, based on our personal experience, our knowledge of the inventory and of the industry itself, we believe that we can actually. Sulphur scrap about 80% of that $504,000 worth of inventory at the original price that we paid for it. So our original valuation of 97,000 is now incorrect. And we were wondering if. We could bump that up to about 101,000. Obsolescent inventory and sell the remaining 403,000 as inventory as scrap, and again that #403 as sellable as scrap is based off of our experience in the industry and the current industry itself as well as industry market conditions.......0.9294\n",
            "Auditor: OK. Do you, would you mind just explaining to me what evidence or like how you came up with that number? I know you've told me based on you know your your industry experience but. How exactly would you be selling it? Who would you be selling it to? Just so we can kind of be on the same page here, because obviously our goal together is to provide the most faithful representation of your financial status to, you know, the readers of your financial statements. So I would just be looking to try and. Come up with. Some form of you know verification if you will that you will in fact be able to sell this.......0.8269\n",
            "Client: Yeah, for sure. Like I said, we've been in industry for a while. We understand the market condition in the industry, but we also understand that. We we physically.

            "Auditor: Understood. So let me ask you this, would you guys consider in any way maybe almost getting the difference on it in such a way that we go maybe like? I think the halfway point between the 378 and the original 97,000. Comes out to two. Comes out to. Approximately 230,235 hundred. If I've done my math correctly. Would you consider splitting the difference and we will for this year because again, you're kind of you're making an estimate. You're not certain that that's what's going to be able to happen. You can split the difference and then next year, if you do in fact make this sale, then we can go back and readjust your numbers.......0.4563\n",
            "Client: I still think that valuation is pretty high based on our current knowledge of the industry and the industry itself. We would be willing to go up to. Maybe of valuation? Of 140,000 for obsolescent INR. And that is putting us that that's saying that we would only be able to sell approximately 75% of our. Old inventory back at its original cost instead of the original 85% valuation.......0.7783\n",
            "Auditor: Gotcha. So when you when you did your breakdown of the 8020 of which it would be sellable for scrap or whatever and the 20% you wouldn't where what was the 20% is that stuff that currently has logos on it because I know that licensing was part of the issue with your products. So is the material that is currently logoed. Is that what comprises the 20%? You think that? You would have to write off and the rest of it is unlogged and can just be sold as scrap or some of the breakdown. That I'm not aware of at the moment.......0.0\n",
            "Client: No, exactly. That was a. That was a nice breakdown of what we have. We believe that the 20% we wouldn't be getting much for scrap or anything out of it. We wouldn't be able to sell it using our our new business strategy. So based on our current business strategy, we would just like to to write that off the remaining 20.......0.4767\n",
            "Auditor: OK, I understand and. And who who would you anticipate selling this to? Because my guess would tell me that if you're selling it back to the provider, your original vendor that you got the material, that they're not going to be very enthusiastic about buying it at the same price that they sold. It to you at.......0.8283\n",
            "Client: Well, I mean that is a good point. But our our relationship with the vendors are very strong. We've been doing business with them for over 4 years. We still do business that with them using our new strategy.......0.8121\n",

            "Auditor: OK, so 150,000 of obsolescence. To put in the. Account and then the remainder we would assume is being sold. Or returned for that matter, maybe a more appropriate description. OK. I I think. I'd be willing to work with that. But what would make me the most comfortable with accepting that number is that I would have to include, in my opinion of the audit. There would have to be some disclaimer about this information stating that this is what's happening. The obsolescence, the portion that is not being considered obsolete is kind of contingent upon vendors. Taking the material. Back or someone else you're finding some other willing participant to purchase the material that they. Can then use.......0.9377\n",

            "Client: So the the allowance for the full count increases from 100,000 and 9097 to now is 450,000 in current year.

So there's four years. So we allocate. Another year to increase our. Reduction to put the amount that we are going to allocate into the reduction in allowance for doubtful account.......0.5994\n",

            "Client: So it's like $108,902.00. Like if I allocate it in four years, so the number will become 100 and 8902. Dollars. So it will be. Putting it in our allowance for the full account and it also put it in our revenue. That's a reduction in allowance. Reduction account so it will. Increase our revenue at the same time that. At the same. Time sure. So.......0.8664\n",
            "Auditor: Let me just. See if I have the numbers correct here. So minus 108902. So you would maintain 108 nine O2 in the allowance account and then you would be putting 320-6706. Into your other revenue reduction account. Which would then actually increase your revenue for for this fiscal year? Am I understanding that correct?......0.3939\n",
            "Client: Yes, yes.......0.6597\n",
            "Auditor: OK, I've definitely you know, I'm definitely pleased to hear the movement. I was concerned that. You know there. Might be a little bit of. A you. Know might be. A little adversarial in trying to come to an. Agreement here compromise. What I have done? Is I looked at your aging schedule for your past. First collection history as well as your Q 42000 collection. Actually came up with six sets of numbers and how I arrived at these numbers was I did a best case, worst case and a median case scenario of what your allowance would actually be, which your collections would be and and then with the subtraction it would leave an allowance amount. So if we use, if we go based off of your Q 42000 collection history, the worst case scenario I came. Up with is. Just shy of 150,000, it's 149 nine 8510. Now I'm sure you I would like to have faith in your your accounts receivable department, so we certainly wouldn't want to be in a worst case scenario. The best case scenario is 52, seven, 2637 and that's working on the assumption that every one of your vendors. Pay their accounts at the best possible collection rate you know historically. The median, which you know I think is somewhere the most likely scenario I came up with is 10135574. It's actually pretty close to the number that you guys have come up with. I understand where you arrived at your number. Goes by dividing it over the course of four years, and that does make a reasonable amount of sense. However, I feel like you know just splitting the cost, we're splitting the collection rates is maybe the most. Appropriate. One of the concerns I had about having such a high allowance account is, and I don't mean to suggest any impropriety. I'm certainly not trying to do that, but it could be perceived as a scenario where you're trying to allow for some. Income smoothing for future years. Which is one of the reasons why I wanted to or. I was hoping that we could bring that number down. I also crunched the numbers and you know, the way you had it, it was currently. Almost 69 1/2% of your current receivable account balance. It was also just shy of 21% of your revenues and I think we can probably agree that that's a pretty high number relative to your revenue. Certainly that does come down considerably by lowering it to 108. 902 How how would you guys feel about splitting the difference on my 101 and change in your, you know, just shy of 109 and maybe agreeing on 100? And 5000. As the the amount for your allowance account.......0.9821\n",
            "Client: So you suggest that putting uh one oh $5000 to our allowance for doubtful account and to the reduction in allowance account.......-0.34\n",
            "Auditor: 105. Either the remaining portion. Would would be credited into your other income, your other revenue account, the the reduction. So I think that would 430-5608 minus one O 5. So that would put. 336 O 8 into your reduction account.......0.3612\n",
            "Client: Give me a second.......0.0\n",
            "Auditor: I recognize that this is a little bit a little bit lower than you know what you had suggested. The only reason that I suggested is because. Close it slightly above. It's splitting the difference for the two members that we both feel most comfortable. It's still actually putting it slightly higher than median collection rate for your increase in history in 2000.......0.6087\n",

It's actually a little bit closer to the number you that you had suggested that it is to my median number, but it's a number that I still feel comfortable with. I would certainly like it to be a little bit lower, but I feel comfortable if this number is being you know. A fair representation of your financial status and the current status of your accounts receivable.......0.9669\n",

            "Auditor: Absolutely. So what I have. Here I'll start with the accounts receivable since that's. The 1:00 we we just completed. We're going to.

You think that you can find someone else. In a similar industry, you know? Potentially, you know possibly. A competitor that you'll be able to pass off if you will.

Off but since. You're not opposed to me putting in a notation in the notes at the end of the audit report, just stating the potential for next year that it may or may not be able to be sold, and if it's not, then we will in turn address that at the appropriate time.

The equipment like OK since like most of the equipment that's still in storage, I mean. Most of them are obsolete, the rest, like you said, should be sold obviously at a lower price just because it's old equipment and. Market value, you know, will value well, it's at a different price than market value. I just feel like it might be a problem because. If you record it. For next period, it won't really reflect what we did in the period before or the year before if. That makes sense.......-0.8029\n",
            "Client: Yeah, that makes sense. Well, well for to be. Safe for both of us. Well, just we can accept like the 9797 K of inventory loss per your company's review of expertise.......0.9042\n",

I guess I want to hear what your #1 alternative is. Maybe we can like negotiate something off of that and so. I guess both perspectives.......0.9402\n",
            "Client: Sure. So like for the 42% of the inventory that you you have like you have question about, we probably couldn't be easily seldom. So we well we could if we couldn't sell it as a finishing product, we could easily sell them as a. Scrapped and so if we could sell like we think like within from today to next year, it would be very easy for us to sell like 100%.......0.9241\n",

I would choose, for instance, a loss due to market decline of inventory of. $378,000 and then a reduction in allowance for doubtful accounts for $200,000, so. I guess I can explain to you what that reflects. So that would be reflecting kind of what you said before about the revised amount of obsolete inventory, but then again taking that 40, so like that 42% is old inventory. So then again assuming that if you break it down. 25% of the old inventory that you could sell it at. Cost or for? For scrap value. That way you can. Like earn at least.......0.8299\n",

            "Auditor: Yeah. So it would be at cost to value just because let's see 25%. I'm trying to skim through the reading here. I know that OK, so 42% of ending in so 42% would be the old inventory and we feel that about 25% of that amount. Could be sold at original cost because the rest or the 75% that's left. Of the old. Inventory can't really be recovered just because we know that CWN's products can't be sold at like their present state. Because they might like contain some of their logo logos, or they might have expired under licensing agreements.

Might be different for you, but like for column D under mine it says like looking at like the income statement loss due to market decline of inventory is 378,000.

            "Auditor: OK, so our only problem is is that like out of that 42% we chose 25% as to like what you put sell just because? Like I mentioned before, like the other 75% can't really recover. Well, you can't make any profit just because. The I know your companies products are unique in such a way they might contain. It might contain some of your logos that were already expired. Remember, under, remember how you guys have a licensing agreement, how that's expired already. So I mean, like you can't really sell those at like? A market. So like you can't tell it. It's like what, a product like yours would be selling in the market just because like they're already going off speed. So I mean, I think the best way or the best alternative is for you guys to sell.

They have bigger reputations and based on their like history financial report, they always pay their suppliers back and.

Much of the inventory that is actually at your warehouse as well, some of it is from the prior year. So then we sent in the well to do substance substantive. It looked like your accounting system couldn't really track inventory the way it should have, so we couldn't actually. So when you look at the aging analysis on the slow moving goods, it's not accurate. So that's why we're kind of a little bit on the. Lower end percentile, I guess like we said 25%.

I couldn't like it's kind of. The old strategy. So that come out the number is 404 K so. Yeah, four one. No 5504 K. And so and like and then they just assume I can sell. 75% and.

A loss, a loss of inventory for 370-8000 and then a reduction in 200,000. So I guess it's from like the second one, the numbers are. A little bit more. Is closer value.......0.9211\n",

It's it's a little bit. It's a little bit disruptive to the investors. Because high. High estimates of bad debts results in conservative conservative income statements estimates. I mean. So I feel that my idea of where all the allowance for doubtful accounts should be somewhere around a reduction of 200. Around 200 and 300.

It's too soon to determine these factors, but. I'm not going to tell you to go all out and do a whole production in accounts allows for doubtful accounts, but in the range of where I was I would.

What I would like the company to consider at the at the market risk being publicly auditing firm, I mean or publicly traded company SEC is going to. Swap huge fines if we the financial statements that we give to the public are not reliable, whether that I would like to mention is the reputation risk. That comes with the with the company. If we go ahead and we raise our financial statements that are not reliable to the to the shareholders with market risk also comes the liability risk that you can get fined for. Not giving the correct financial statements. There is also from your end, I understand that you are more so inclined to give a good financial report as a business risk of not being able to meet your meet your goals. So from that.

Considering the amount of upstreet inventory that you have, 97 is pretty low and what that that does when you write off less inventory, what is doing to the balance sheet is that it showing that you have more in assets. Yeah, so we cannot write the the reason why I was going with the 25%. Proposition is because it's able to, it's not able. I mean you are able to cover yourself from. Inflating your balance sheet. If we go with a 97,000, you are what the remainder all of it is going into the balance sheet, which means that you are showing your. Investors, you have a lot of.

That's why I'm leaning more towards the 25% which we already know in capture. If we want to try to make that look like 150 can be sold. In the future.

So if we're going into our fourth quarter, you know it should be significantly higher than than than 1/4.

We we've got a, we've got a spread here where we've got 550% collectible on the rest of that on the way all the way up to 70 and 90% collect.

Not for the that. Which is over 120 days. But beyond that, and especially considering that our new customers are much larger and much more reliable. Sources of revenue that that will help offset any risk that you know the rest pool might be you know 9090 to 120 day period anyways and you know obviously any more than that can you know is great to be going forward but it it seems to me that that's very conservative.

Changing customer base and the best case scenario is about, you know 25,000. And how do we account for that?

We can't.......0.7059\n",
            "Auditor: I put it. Yeah. What? I put the reason I'm using the historical data is because that's more reliable. If I use what you have gone through with the changes for the for the fourth quarter, it's actually higher because it's it's 85 to 95. Your uncorrectables are are. Way over. They are higher than actually we are estimating. If you were to do that, you would be more at the default right now because it's like saying most of the customers you're selling to aren't going to pay you. Yeah, so that's why I'm going with the historical data, because we if we are using. What we have right now, it will show that you are selling to people who are not going to pay you, but at the same time you are saying that your revenue is going to be higher. It is misleading in both ways. So what we want to do is that go with the historical data, but consider all, all all from from 60 to 120 do an estimate for for that amount which is. It doesn't make a big difference from 35. And the balance that should be on there is one. 102.......0.1385\n",

So you know, right now 435 is is ridiculously conservative, but you know 102 seems you know at least has a grounding in the in the aging of accounts standard here that that is pointed out so that that.

Yeah. So that's my first solution to write off $200,000 of inventory and write off about $47,000 of accounts receivable. And the reason I'm the reason I'm proposing such a big amount for the write off is because you're like 42% of your inventory is based on the old marketing strategy and. I feel like I thought if you guys try to sell it under the old under the this inventory then it's going to be first of all your licensing. The license agreements are. So I think it's, I think it's best to get rid of this inventory and just start start fresh with your current inventory under the current marketing marketing strategy.

Than 50. $1000 like if you look at some of your. Receivables that are you know due. There are more than there are more than $50,000 as well, so I think 35,600 and. Eight is is a little. Too low? OK, but I do. Agree with you that the 435. 1000 is a lot for a reserve. When I was going through. Everything that's the first. That's one of the first questions that I had. Was that? Why is it?

Because it's been over a quarter, it's been longer than you know, 1/4 and you still have not received the payments from these guys from these other your other 37 customers. So how how reasonable do you think you're going to get those? Get that money? Or should we? Should we work on writing that amount off? It's completely using a lot. Using allowance of the $100,000.

It will still be the case for the other customers because, yeah. Before we have our own marketing strategies, old vendors. And these 30,000 customers fit in that category. So I think the best collection history data is still reliable. So I think we, yeah, we still we still. Expect to collect. Somewhere from 5% to 50%. Yeah. So we can run off.

            "Client: So you're saying that reinstate what? What? You said earlier. You you saying that you want to? You want to write off about 200,000 of the market of the inventory of the old inventory. Is that correct?......0.3736\n",
            "Auditor: Yeah, I want to write off 200,000. So you're saying that 504,000 is the?......0.3612\n",

            "Client: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.......0.6808\n",
            "Auditor: That's 104,000, right? So. What I'm suggesting is that you. You know, go through your. What I was going to suggest is you go through your inventory and see which or which ones you can sell the the old inventory out of the 504,000, which ones you can sell currently and write off the rest and you're telling me that you can sell 90% of that? And so then we only write off 50,400. You see, The thing is, how are you going to even if you do manage, sell 90%. Let's say you know you do manage sell 90% but you're you have expiring licensing agreements the your license agreements for the old inventory is expired. So that's going to renew the licensing agreements that's going to cost you money. In plus the production cost all that. So you're going to have. You can have so much more expenses associated with this inventory that's not even part of your marketing strategy anymore. So I, so I I don't understand why you want to, you know keep. This inventory, if you. I'm willing to negotiate down from $200,000. That was just a benchmark that I'm selling, but I'm willing to go down from that. But to a reasonable amount, I think 50,400 is too low. Yeah, definitely. Well, but I'm willing to write. I'm willing to write off, you know, amounts in the hundreds because. I think it's best I think it's best for. You guys and for us? Especially for you guys because think about it. You. It's the one time write. Offs. Actually you don't have to worry about this. Inventory again and you can just you can solely focus on you know maximizing your current inventory under the new marketing model and you know maximize sales from that. So you have nothing to worry about about the old old inventory, absolutely nothing. And you can maximize your sales and it. Will help you. Will help you avoid the expenses of, you know, the old inventories, licensing agreements, production cost and every everything else associated with with that inventory. So if you like I. I'm not expecting you to get 200,000. Dollars. Let's be real. So I will say 100 and 150,000 be right off of inventory.......0.9926\n",
            "Client: OK. So thank you for for the suggestion. I think that is a very realistic view for writing off and. However, I think we have. From our company we have someone to have like take a a look at the inventory to physical inspections and everything and based on our data from the inventory of the lessons review, we have come up with 70. $97,000 which could? We right are written off and we think that $97,000 based on our data, our inventory in our current markets, understanding and conditions. We think that $97,000 would be a reasonable amount or you can do another. Math calculations which is which will give you another number very close to $97,000. So let's let's say you can look at the total amount of 500,000 dollars, 500,000. And and $544,000 for our inventory. Right and. We are we we figure out that at least 80% of the the inventory can be sold as scrap. So we don't have to spend any. Any. Yeah, any. Any additional costs on licensing or anything like that because. It it can be sold as scrap at the original cost, so it doesn't cost anything to buy license or to marketing or to to do any additional expenses. So yeah, 80% of the old. And we can be so ascribe for sure, based on our knowledge of inventory industry and the current market situations. Yeah. So we suggest about, right right off about 95,000 to 100,000. Dollars. Yeah, you can do the math. So 20% of $504,000 is. About a hundred, 100,000 and. $100,000. Yeah. And that amount we think that would be a reasonable amount to to write off as the lost for the old inventory.......0.9678\n",
            "Auditor: Now, can you one of my others? What are my other options? One of my other solutions for the inventory was. Instead of the 150,000. I was going to propose 125. So that's you're saying that 80% is, you're saying that 80% can be sold as crap, but. And you're saying that 90% is also prior prior to that you said 90%?......-0.2477\n",
            "Client: Yeah. So we were being very optimistic that we could sell 90%, but like based on like your your amount of suggestions. So we we are willing to negotiate. So we are being like more realistic and we are like based on the real market situation within that 80% would be like a regional amount that we can surely can sell them as crap to the yeah without additional cost. But yeah, we are we were being optimistic about selling 90%. But we are willing to negotiate down to 80%, yeah.......0.9832\n",
            "Auditor: You go down just a little bit and maybe 120. I helped you guys. I I was willing to negotiate for the accounts receivable. And I think we, I think I'm optimistic about the accounts receivable based on your based on the BIG4 customer customers that you have something to say about that. However, I'll be I'll be very comfortable if we can get to $125,000 for the inventory write down. And even if you, even if you get $225,000 of the write down, it's your your net income is still going to be a you know a reasonable amount. So if we can, you know, if we can meet at 125,000. For the inventory write down, I would you know, I'd be comfortable. I'll be very comfortable with that and you know would be, it would be conservative, it's a conservative amount and we don't want to miss the, our our you know shareholders and everything else and our all the other interests that the company has. If you write down this $125,000. It's only going to it's going to help you avoid the other. It's going to, like I said the the what if you can't get solar for? Then you have to worry about the inventory apps, the licensing agreements and all that. So I think it's, I think it's best it's it's best that we. We, you know, arrive. At 125,000. And then you if you you believe. That you can sell the rest off. Then we'll then I'll be comfortable with that. And then you can just focus solely on the inventory that is, you know, remaining under the old, under the new marketing strategy, you can just focus on that one. And everybody's happy.......0.9863\n",

            "Client: Race I I think it makes sense because actually, maybe sometimes you may have the, although we have the estimate of 80% we can sell due to the sometimes it's uncertainty we may lower 5% of the sales. It makes sense for them to. To the 125,000 and it doesn't make any income decrease a lot, so it's.......-0.5574\n",

Tell them. 80% of them will sell them, will sell, will be sold at cost. Yes. Yeah, OK. And well understand that you think the 97 is a little bit too low. So we can be honest with you.

Just because something can be sold doesn't necessarily mean that. It will be. So I think it might be a little. Bit better if we shoot for something at the decent amount higher than that just because.

A little bit more now and that way I. Can I feel that it's the? Bigger hit now will more. Accurately reflect what? Is going on. It won't be as drastic going into the next period.

And our concerns with from your owners about. How well the. Company is performing and I wouldn't want that to be damaged by having a very large loss going into a new period.

            "Auditor: All right. So hello guys. I have called this meeting because I've, upon reviewing your financial statements, I have an interest on the valuation of two specific accounts. In specific, I want to talk about the valuation of the inventory as well as the allowance for doubtful accounts. So upon review of the financial statements, I believe that these two accounts need revision on the number that you guys would like to. So for example you guys. You guys have 42% of old inventory that use the old marketing strategy for your company and you guys propose a write off of 97,000? However, since the company wasn't able to provide an aging analysis for this, the auditing firm took it upon ourselves to look at the marketing strategy marketing. I'm sorry. Look at the market. The industry and the results of a price testing done on the inventory. And it was actually concluded that only 25% of the old inventory from that old marketing strategy could be sold as scrap. So as a result of that, the other 75% of the old inventory, unless there's some type of reinvestment in it. From changing it, renewing the licenses or changing the specific parts that make it that make it impossible for. It to be. Sold to other retailers, that amount has to be written off. So. I'm sorry, did you?......0.6767\n",
            "Client: Say something. No, but well, we have at least 80% of it. Can we sell the scrap at the current rate at market value and then we've determined that we can actually sell all of our products. Eventually we have the market and once we renew our licenses and get everything updated, it can all be sold at the original cost of our full inventory of 1.2 million.......0.8807\n",
            "Auditor: OK, I understand that. However, since it is not certain and it is basically a contingency as the other, I have to make sure that the statements represent faithfully represent the financial situation of the company. And as of this point right now only 25% of. That can be. Sold so. Because of that, I know that you guys are willing to reinvest in the old in the old products, but since it's still a contingency, I don't think it's. I don't think it's faithfully represents if we write off the entire, only the 97,000. So therefore, hold on one second.......0.7789\n",
            "Client: Yes, at first y'all were suggesting that it's 97 K final write offs. You're suggesting more?......0.4019\n",
            "Auditor: Yes. Because as I said before, you guys have a 1.2 million total inventory of that 504 is old inventory and of that 500 and four, 504,000 inventory only 25%. Or 126,000 is can be sold as scrap at this moment.......0.4019\n",
            "Client: Now with ours, we've got 80% can be sold once we renew our licenses. Our I mean sold as scrap right now. So that's how we can come up with a 97,000.......0.0\n",
            "Auditor: Can be sold as.......0.0\n",
            "Client: Scrap 80%.......0.0\n",
            "Auditor: It. Well, that's a huge difference from. The calculation from the market and the prices price testing.......0.5267\n",
            "Client: It's rather optimistic that we can sell. It all at 80%, but according to the controller and the CEO, I believe it's able to be sold all of it. It's not a determined time when it can be sold, but it can be so.......-0.2273\n",
            "Auditor: Exactly. So as you're as I said before, it's just a contingency, so in reality. If you look. At the market and the industry, it's an average that only 25% can be sold because there's the contingency that the company might not actually reinvest in those. Both products and that the licenses might not be renewed. So as of now. Only 25% of the old inventory can be sold as scrap. However you guys say 80%, right?......0.0\n",
            "Client: 80 can be sold surcharge.......0.0\n",
            "Auditor: Right. So. I don't think a number would realistically represent the what can be sold scrapped at this moment. I think it's too high, honestly, because like I said at one point, maybe you guys don't actually reinvest or don't actually renew the licenses. How about? So you guys wanted to? Write off only 97,000. OK.......0.8078\n",
            "Client: You know there's.......0.0\n",
            "Client: No way you're going to go with this zero right off that we can value everything at 1.2 million.......0.0516\n",
            "Auditor: No, absolutely not.......-0.296\n",
            "Client: Though we thought possibly our second option for option B, having written off 97,000 which was the. 42% and then the I'm not the 42%, the 504,000 then 80% of that eventually being sold came out to be about 97,000.......0.0\n",
            "Auditor: OK. So you guys are right off 97. So how does the number? How does 115?......0.5563\n",
            "Client: I think the actual calculation was 103,000.......0.0\n",
            "Auditor: For for you guys or for me?......0.0\n",
            "Client: For us, I thought a. 80% of 504. We're just doing a quick calculation.......0.0\n",
            "Auditor: OK.......0.296\n",
            "Client: About 100,000.......0.0\n",
            "Client: Yeah. Yeah, so.......0.5267\n",
            "Client: 100,800.......0.0\n",
            "Client: You want, so it would so 80% of the 504,000 would be about 100,800.......0.0772\n",
            "Auditor: 100,800, yeah. OK. OK. Still feel that number is low because like I said, and even you said it, that's with the company looking at everything optimistically. So like I said, we have to look at. This realistically, as of this moment, the real number is only 25%. So at most hold on one second.......0.9283\n",
            "Client: Well worth.......0.4588\n",
            "Client: 26,000 is that the number you wanted?......0.0772\n",
            "Auditor: Yes, we want 126,000. It's the most realistic, according to the market in the industry at this moment.......0.4588\n",
            "Client: And you said offered 115.......0.0\n",
            "Auditor: I'm sorry.......-0.0772\n",
            "Client: Go about halfway 115.......0.0\n",
            "Auditor: Yes, that's what I suggested at first.......0.4019\n",
            "Client: OK. All right, 115.......0.4466\n",
            "Auditor: 115, OK.......0.4466\n",
            "Client: And then the second. Topic was our allowance for duffel accounts, yes.......0.4019\n",
            "Auditor: So for this one. You guys have recently changed the marketing strategy? From a few. I'm sorry from many small retailers to a few large ones. Yeah. And as a result of that, we feel that there's could be a shift in the collectability of the accounts receivables that you guys have. So upon looking at the accounts receivable charts that was provided to us, we. Well, I'm looking at the previous year statements. We feel that the allowance for doubtful accounts has been overstated in the previous years. And until now, it hasn't been a material amount. But at this point it's starting to become larger and thus it is becoming also material. So we feel that the allowance for doubtful accounts should be reduced. Shouldn't it should be reduced? Because ultimately in the last couple of years the accounts receivable, I'm sorry the allow allowance for account for for doubtful accounts has been increased. But it has been it has been exceeding the actual write offs. So we feel that the company may be overestimating the allowance without full accounts.......-0.4039\n",
            "Client: Yeah, so your suggestion reduced our, yes, so.......0.5994\n",
            "Auditor: We were looking at the. The collectibility of the accounts receivable and based on the lower percentages of. Each category depending on the dates. We feel that approximately 300,000 should be the reduction in the allowance for the lawful accounts.......-0.296\n",
            "Client: OK. We so we had. Ours at 400,000, yeah. The reason is why we want to stay there, because we have reduced from 120 companies that purchase from us to only four and the four may not have perfect payment histories. But if you see with our. OK. Well, with our scheduled Table 3. Our collectibility percentage has gone up after reducing the amount of people we sell to. So we feel like it would be OK to keep it at 400 because we're going to get those payments. Well, 95% chance we'll get those payments.......0.9636\n",
            "Auditor: Hold on one second. OK so. You guys are currently. At 135,000 and 608. And as I said before. We have to be conservative in the amounts. That we feel. We are going to receive well you as the company has to be conservative in the amounts. That you're reporting. So as a result of that, we calculated what the accounts receivable account should be based on the lower percentages of the actual electable amount.......0.4278\n",
            "Client: Moms for each table are each so the 85 and 75 for 6190 and all that.......0.0\n",
            "Auditor: I'm sorry. Can you repeat that?......-0.0772\n",

            "Auditor: OK. Hold on one second. OK. So we actually calculated the amount based on the total account receivable.......0.7065\n",
            "Client: OK.......0.296\n",
            "Auditor: And based on that, that's where. We got the. A a month that I previously mentioned.......0.0\n",
            "Client: OK.......0.296\n",
            "Auditor: So you guys wanna stay? As high as possible because of the change in the marketing strategy, we also we can also look at. We have the percentages for the past years collection and in general they have been. It's pretty safe to say that those numbers can be used. So how about? I'm sorry one second. OK, so how about we reduce the write off to a 260,000?......0.8509\n",
            "Client: Where you're at 300 before.......0.0\n",

I basically want to ensure that I provide a faithful representation of your company, and I also want to ensure that I provide reasonable assurance that your statements are free of material misstatement. So when it comes to. The issue with. Inventories. I'm basically suggesting that your company increase inventory actually. About 75% of old materials. Because these all material bases only relate to unique items in and it also relates to licensing agreements that basically had expired. So it won't basically. Produce any value to your organization.......0.9688\n",

That would help us close our book for the 2015 year, and we're seeking your advice regarding a few numbers that you mentioned basically, or more specifically the inventory and the account receivable number as you as you already stated. Lauren, do you want? To add anything.......0.9827\n",

            "Auditor: And what are your plans for selling office or inventory being that a percentage of it basically relies on licensing agreements that are expired and basically you will need more investments in order to get these inventories of these sales. You know you have to consider the cost and benefit across as far as like the the cost of getting these these items. Basically up to being sellable. So have you guys considered that?......0.765\n",
            "Client: Yeah. Hence that's why we think that 80% of it can be sold. Sorry, maybe we we should clearly state that more than 80% of it could be sold, but we we're probably going to get 80% of the. Total value back.......0.6597\n",
            "Auditor: Items be sold the 80% because you have to consider that and then a comment period that I'm creating audit for only writing down inventory for 97% will still be material because my audit firm has a 50% of revenues based off as their. That's my maturity level. So anything above that will basically. Increase the risk of the term statement. So only decrease the inventories by 97,000 will basically leave your net inventory levels above.

We don't believe that our historical data is relevant because we have switched strategies and switched from going to having 120 small retailers selling our products to four big retailers. And because those retailers have a much better track record in marketplace and the data in the last few months has proven that they're very reliable. Partner in this, we believe that our. Reduction for doubtful accounts should not be based off our previous numbers and should be really thought of anew, and we'd like to have that at 400,000.......0.1531\n",

Large retailer, their track record of paying us would actually be pretty high compared to all the owner account that we've been dealing with. Hence we actually don't think that $200,000 is the correct number. We think that we're going to be able to get a lot of those out, the 435 K that we have. On that, the full account right now, I. Think we're gonna. Be able to get at least 90. 5% of it back. So hence. So we're we're referring to.

You have to consider that if you only if you can leave on 400 for loans without full account, that's nearly more than half your total accounts receivable.

And I also I estimated the over 120 days to 15%. I kind of came with that average and I came up with your loan for Doctor. Council. Have the easy balance of about. 1:15. Because when you do aging of the age, when you the aging skeleton, you basically have to take a percentage of each of those values based on their their their age or the age of uncollectible. And you basically have to collect them and put them all together to get the total amount of how much allowance for that account should be. So I don't think just taking 90%.

Our accounting system cannot adequately track inventory and thus cannot provide an aging analysis on slow moving goods. As an alternative, the auditing firm sent the Vice President, chief of Operations and Chief Chief Financial Officer into the warehouse to identify obsolete inventory estimate possible right off amount. We don't think that was the right group to send in to the the warehouse that they don't work with the materials on such a regular basis.

And now with the new vision and the new strategy. Plan with our new CEO. We're moving towards a different direction and our new direction mainly focuses on dealing with larger retailers and four main larger retailers. So currently based off of. The last quarter I'd say over 75% of our sales are sales towards the larger retailers. So there's a lot of changes and we are moving from our current or my our old direction and moving towards a new direction. So what we're trying to maintain or establish is a good relationship and a close relationship with our four biggest customers, super colossal discount suburbia, mega Department and Ultra stores. Prior to that we had. Like I mentioned, the 120, so in terms of that perspective, our accounts receivable, we were still collecting from a large of those smaller retailers.

And and and in terms of that, there's a big change and I think the estimate that I have personally on paper doesn't I believe doesn't reflect what we should be. Projecting because with with the relationship that we have in the new market strategy and based off of just the last quarter that we've had, we feel very confident that the reduction in allowance for doubtful accounts should be dramatically reduced in, in terms of dramatically reduced. I mean from the numbers given. Here in front of me. So that's 11 concern that I have and I wanted to address with you.......0.659\n",
            "Client: OK.......0.296\n",
            "Auditor: OK, sure. So yeah, I'm definitely aware. So we're pretty much on the same page. I'm definitely aware that the CWN college where novelties has gone through like a new customer base. So from what I understand that is accounts receivable will definitely be changed though, so we're saying so I believe you just said that what your goal is is to reduce account the. Allowance for doubtful accounts.......0.9595\n",
            "Client: Yes, Sir.......0.4019\n",
            "Auditor: OK, I understand. So yeah, and I agree, I think like you know CWN, it's this like the whole goal is that we still kind of generate that CWN is still able to generate good profits and collect a majority of their net accounts receivable. So my one concern with this before. Coming into our specific negotiation of numbers is that the collectibility with the new customer base might be somewhat risky, so when reviewing. Compared with the with the new customer base, The thing is that you're not too sure CWN might not be too sure about their history of paying paying off the debts, and whether or not they generate like a bad debt expense. So I would say that even if you want to reduce rather than reducing. It maybe you could try to. Maybe we could both try to meet somewhere in the middle and come to a ground. That's. Both conservative, but. A reduction of lines that for doubtful accounts that's not too harmful or deleterious to the company's prop. So yeah, so OK, that's definitely. So I think we can work with. The allowance for doubtful accounts at first. So in terms of your options, what were you specifically suggesting? Like, what's the range that you think the Doppler account should be used by?......0.9346\n",
            "Client: I I, since you're an expert in it and and I have my numbers given that I've done my calculations, but I'm not 100% sure. So for me I'm just not comfortable giving out a number without just being more confident. So based off of your.......-0.3314\n",

            "Auditor: OK. Price range. OK, I understand. So let me first start out. So what I understand from CW's authorities is that are reasonable deduction that they're looking at is kind of simplistic. They just wanted to take out 97. Brand, which is basically a good small amount and it's taking into consideration that their clientele will not have a lot of that debt expense. So I think I have a couple of generations. I have a couple of. Different numbers that I found in terms of decreasing the allowance for doubtful accounts. So obviously the most conservative one would be to decrease it by a number of which is like about 40 percent, 435 grand, but at the same time, I understand that we're also. Trying to maintain profits and maintain a good net accounts receivable. So I'm giving you the numbers that I've just given you, right is the one that The CW is generated which is about 97g. So say close to 100,000 to make it easier and the one that I'm giving you is about 430,000 which you might think obviously think is too much. For deduction, so for net accounts receivable, for the allowance for doubtful accounts, how would you fare with something between 200,000 and 300,000 in terms of deduction?......0.9669\n",

            "Auditor: So as I'm seeing accounts receivable right now was I think 627,000 as a total for in the balance sheet. So as a percentage that would be about 300,000 would be maybe a little bit less than half. And I guess the 200,000 would be around 40% or so.......0.0\n",

What I have right here is some of the item descriptions and what I was thinking shakar based off of the numbers that I. Have is the items that we have a lot of quantity on on hand we can just take that off of the list and just take that as a loss. But in terms of the items that we we feel like we're selling and we feel like we can get back. A profit from I feel like that we should. We shouldn't take the risk of writing that off and. And probably we can like meet or talk about a certain number of quantity of items. So if it's like over 200, then we can just take that as a loss. That's just an example. If it's below that then we can take that as a profit.......0.9794\n",

So the 97,000 I believe is. Is it's actually. A little bit too low in my own opinion. So if we set that as the inventory valuation of decreased, what this what could happen? In future periods, there would be a a problem with the numbers, so there might be inherent risk is meaning in terms of transactions. There might be a risk of material. Statement.

So historically, when people don't pay you back for more than 120 days, they're really not likely to. Pay back at all. Most people have the allowance. For not mostly.

You don't want to come back and make adjustments in your financial statements. If the adjustments look good, then yeah, all right. It's it's making more value on your inventory.

            "Auditor: Definitely that agrees with the with the auditor's, you know, point of view that since you guys are changing your market strategy then your reduction in your doubtful accounts. Perfect 1000 is good with you guys or I mean?......0.8271\n",

            "Auditor: Yeah. So so there's there's two issues that we've seen during our audit work. The first one I wanted to discuss and we got. UM. Yes, the the inventory valuation is the first problem we can discuss. So I'll just, I'll just let you know what we have and then and then you give us your rationale for your number. So we're tracking that you guys were using old inventory. From an old marketing strategy where you're selling to many different retailers, small retailers and whatnot, and that inventory is valued roughly around $504,000. Based on the industry, we know that in reality only about 25% of that inventory can be sold and it's going to be sold for scrap. And so that's about $126,000 and the other 75,000 can't be sold because it's either. It's either too unique to your guys. Product or it has logos on it which you guys don't hold the licensings for anymore and that's that's $378,000 that we're anticipating as being obsolete because there's essentially nothing you can do for there's no longer a. Market for it and you no longer have the license. Sell it. So we're just wondering where where you guys came up with the $97,000 obsolete? Number and and and how we might be able to. Work to get. Closer to to a true obsolete number.......-0.0516\n",

            "Client: OK, OK.......0.5267\n",
            "Client: Ohh so based on our experience and knowledge about our industry, so we think for our old inventories there are almost 80% old inventory can be sold in the original cost. But from your view is like the 25% right? So that's the big difference. And from this percentage we calculate, we calculate our inventory, we found there should be around 100,000 inventory. Cannot be sold in in the original cost. So we decide just right of like 97,000 I guess, OK.......0.9325\n",
            "Auditor: So I don't want to. Break character here and I know you guys received. Different information then. Than I did here, but what I mean where? Where do you think the big disconnect is from? From my 25% number to your 80% number? By 25% number comes from our partner or our manager. If you give me a second, I can try to find exactly who it is, who has knowledge of the industry.......0.3899\n",
            "Client: Over 80% is coming from. Our controller and the President. They also have much experience in this industry.......0.0\n",
            "Auditor: OK. Do you guys have any data that shows how the how the inventory has moved over the last year? Since you've since you've moved to the new marketing strategy, how has your old inventory moved? Do you know?......0.5382\n",
            "Client: We just have the percent of our old inventory. We just have the percent number.......0.0772\n",
            "Client: We only have the percentage number, but we don't have the actual like the detail about our inventory, how the inventory flows, we don't have that.......0.5267\n",
            "Auditor: OK, well it seems that when we were doing our audit, we discovered that much of the inventory from the prior year still remained in the way. House. And then when we asked for a report showing slow moving inventory, we found out that your accounting system could not actually adequately track inventory and thus you weren't able to provide an agent analysis on the slow moving inventory. It seems like I mean your controller could definitely be correct, but it seems like it would be a large. Leap of faith to just assume that the inventory is is moving or is going to move when when the systems aren't in place to adequately track the inventory. But when we actually do a physical count in the warehouse, most of it is still in there from last year. So if that's the case, would you would you reason that that perhaps the the true number is closer to 25% than the 80? Percent or?......0.9483\n",
            "Client: The last year we didn't. Change our strategy yet? Right, so we can after we change our strategy, the other inventory? We could just sell those order inventory as scrap, right? So but before that, they just sell as like regular inventory or like regular goods, right? So we cannot use that to judge it as. All right.......0.8156\n",
            "Auditor: Can you say that again? I'm sorry, I didn't. I didn't get.......-0.0772\n",
            "Client: So like you just said, like the 25% of our old inventory can say US scrap, right?......0.6794\n",

            "Client: Yeah, yeah, we. But before we change the strategy, this inventory are sold as like regular inventory, right? Yeah, we cannot use that way to judge the old inventory. Use the last year's. Right.......0.8047\n",
            "Auditor: Well, well, we're trying to judge the old inventory right now, right. And so we know that. That the affiliate that your GUYS'S affiliate. Has has been not very profitable at all. It's really been struggling and that's why you guys brought in the new CEO and CFO, it looks like. To to try to change marketing strategies and that's when you guys shifted to a more of a distributor to to the four large retailers. So in doing so, you had you. Had all those products about $504,000 worth of products. In which you were no. Longer selling to your small retailers or you were you were still trying to sell them? Again, they're they're not moving and they're still in the warehouse and. You guys don't control the licensing agreements for the logos that are on nearly 75% of them. So unless unless you guys were thinking about maybe purchasing the licensing agreements again or renewing them we want.......0.4937\n",

            "Client: To be. OK, what is?......0.4466\n",
            "Auditor: What does that look like economically, though? Because we can't just. We can't just go off good faith and say hey. They're going to purchase the license agreements and thus the inventory would not be no, would not be absolutely and would be actual sellable. Do you have an actual number?......0.8967\n",
            "Client: You mean the action number which is sellable you mean?......0.0772\n",
            "Auditor: Yeah. No, like the the number that it would be to to repurchase the licensing agreements or to rework the inventory to make it.......0.5994\n",
            "Client: Actually we don't have. How much do we need to cost to renew the license? We we don't have that number. So in our projects we just estimate the cost.......-0.0572\n",
            "Auditor: OK, OK. Could you? Could you, which one? Which one is Barry? I'm sorry, we. Probably should want you. OK. And and the other gentleman? Tinio OK. Can can one of you guys explain to me? I guess in complete detail your rationale for for the 80% number like? Some sort of proof that the the inventory is actually moving or that it isn't under an unlicensed.......0.9381\n",
            "Client: Oh, so both our controller and President felt that if they if if he did, did not transform the old inventory, so then at least 80% of the of the old inventory could be sold at, correct. So at about its original cost. That's the only thing you know. It's based on our uh management's experience and knowledge. Yeah. And I think our company also consider about our performance and. Like the income statement, so we don't want other people to judge our financial statement and to show that our company was in a bad situation and our see our President, they think they have the ability to. To sell this 80% of the old inventory. I think it's based on their reputation or something else, but they just think that that is possible.......0.2863\n",
            "Auditor: Yeah. No. And I I get that. I understand you want to. Put your best foot forward and and and have a financial statement that looks attractive. But it's important that it's also accurate and and faithfully represented, because if it's not, then you have people making resource allocation decisions based off these financial decisions, and it could. It could lead to a lot of very upset people. With lawyers that like to do a lot of work, and that's certainly something that our firm is not. Inclined to deal with or I imagine. JC or CWN as the affiliate so. I wish there was a way we can get a third party evaluation of the of the inventory and not just. Do you guys, do you guys have any? Idea for for. For where you might be able to move the the inventory valuation. Because you can't. You can't be hard on 80%, right?......0.969\n",
            "Client: You mean the number between or?......0.0772\n",
            "Client: 25 and 80.......0.0\n",
            "Auditor: I I would be fine with with trying to find a number between 25 and 80 because that's obviously where it's going to have to go, but I don't want to just pick something arbitrarily I'd like. To to to have reasoning behind it, you know.......0.5372\n",
            "Client: You have mentioned that our old old inventory is just like staying in our warehouse like for a long time, right? We just want to mention that the old inventory can not sell as like our goods. It doesn't mean that. Cannot sell as crop right scrap, right?......0.7998\n",
            "Auditor: Well, from from our analysis, that's where the the 25% came from, we said yes you can sell it as scrap but the other 75% it says that the excuse me. There's my number here. It says the other 75% is is either too too unique to your specific products. So let's say somebody was taking out if someone was going to buy them for scraps, they would need. They would just be getting certain components. From those. But those components are so unique to your product that it wouldn't be it would. It's not like a universal product that's going to fit on somebody else's equipment. So people aren't going to purchase them because they don't. It's not going to work with what they have. And then to go to go to add into that 75%. And I don't have a breakdown between. Which one is which but. The other part of that 75% is that some of them are are enamored with with logos all over them that you guys no longer have the licensing agreements for. So you want to be able to sell them without some sort of legal issues.......0.8207\n",
            "Client: OK.......0.296\n",

            "Auditor: Yeah, no, if you. If you want if look if you wanna buy licensing agreement. We have to record that purchase. Yeah. And then we can reduce that amount for whatever percentage of inventory that would be covered under the licensing agreements, we can reduce that from from from that 75%.......0.7783\n",
            "Client: OK.......0.296\n",

            "Client: Or in the sentiment we estimate like 2200 thousand, yeah.......0.5719\n",
            "Auditor: Two be honored and in licensing agreements. OK and.......0.8331\n",
            "Client: I'm not sure it's that too high because we only have 500, they're only metric, so that's almost like 40% of the inventory value for the license.......0.4421\n",
            "Auditor: OK.......0.296\n",
            "Client: What's your opinion about that?......0.0\n",
            "Auditor: Yeah. So if if we sell, if we, if we book 200,000 in in licensing purchases. They just don't say how much of the 75% is is under. Under licensing problems. So what I would say is that 200,000 it seems that seems. Generous. So I would say that we could wipe out at least half of of that 75% number. So now we're looking at. When we're looking at 62 1/2% of the old inventory being sellable, yeah. And then the other 37 1/2 being unsellable, does that does that work for you guys, what that looks like financially is? Is we're looking at 315,000 of the 504,000 of old inventory is good. And that means there would be 189,000. So it's almost, it's still almost doubled the 97,000 that you guys originally had.......0.8658\n",

            "Auditor: At 25%, at 25%, we were looking to be able to capture 126,000 in inventory and actual sellable inventory and half into maybe possibly right off nearly 378,000 in obsolete inventory. So now we're down to only 100.......-0.296\n",

            "Auditor: Yeah. So we came down 100. And 89. So let me let. Me. Move some more for you because, yeah, you're putting in 200,000 just to get 189. 1000 worth of inventory. So let me let me see so if. We're going to do. So so this is what we can do. Let's let's let's do 2/3. Alright, let's assume licensing agreements covers 2/3 of the old inventory with you guys doing 200,000. To to. Repurchase licensing agree. It's will not that will change the inventory to 75% being sellable and 25% being obsolete, which means you would be able to save 378,000 in inventory and write off 126,000. So or what?

So that brings the total bad or old inventory to 75%, good 25%. That which means that the 25% bad would equal a write off of $126,000.......0.0772\n",

I'm I'm ending up with a a number of. Of $154,884. So that's at that's at the lowest range of collectibility, the highest our allowance should be is 154 at the highest end of collectibility our our allowance should only be 59,000 and so. You guys are are looking at an allowance right now of of more than double what the lowest range of collectibility and and just for the sake of time to to give you an idea. You're you're. You're reporting that your accounts receivable is 627,480, correct? And your allowance is 435,608. OK, So what this is saying is that 69% or nearly 70% of all your accounts receivables are unlikely to be collected.

            "Client: So I will start talking. About my issue then, yeah. So as a client. We've been negotiating since before about our inventory account, right? Yeah. And we have some old inventory that is like almost expiring. So from the auditors taking the your advice, we needed to write off some of the cars you know no longer using those inventory. So we understand that part. And did you get any information about? Our proposal, our proposed inventory write off. The amount. The amount we propose to write off, do you? Have any information about that?......0.6868\n",

            "Client: Yes, yes, 97,000. So we couldn't provide any like a detailed history about our how our slow moving inventory is right now. But from our experience in the business, we think this 97. And $1000 or even less would be appropriate or reasonable. Amount to put on. The Financial Journal entry and financial statement.

            "Auditor: So from the. Looks of what I've been seeing for the inventory. It seems that you about 1,200,000 as your inventory, but then I also noticed that out of that 1,200,042% of that amount or 504,000 seems to be from the old inventory. Yes. And so out of that now. 25% could be sold at the original cost, but 75% of that amount are unique to your company or. It has the logos that has the expired licensing agreement. I'm proposing that we reduce the inventory amount to. OK. Three, about 378,000.......0.9403\n",
            "Client: So that means we will need to write off more people, right? Write off, happen within this year. Or we could like if if there is any way that we can extend the time. So like for example divide the right off to the two different year. So that we can show more amount of our financial statement because our situation currently is really like.

            "Auditor: OK. But if I'm looking at it, the reason why I stated such a high amount to be written off is because there weren't any sort of supporting evidence to claim that there's there's going to be a change in the old inventories so that it becomes.......0.6572\n",

So there was like a plan within the company to probably we knew our license or you know, invest a little bit of money to this old. Inventory to make it sellable with some additional cost additional price so. But at this point, since this tour is not so clear, we don't want to put every old inventory to the right of account.

            "Client: So if possible, we would just like to keep those as an inventory at this point since our plan for the future is not clear. So that's why we proposed to only write off 97,000 out of the all of the expired inventory.......0.0813\n",

            "Client: So you would like to. So it's like for your point this look like we are hiding inventory that it will that could possibly become like a completely unsellable right? So would it what about since we are not clear about what the deal with this old inventory, all of them? What if we provide some information about? Possible plan. Or how do you say? Like possible plan about how to deal. With this old inventory. So like for now, we can claim absolute amount that will be. Unsalable. OK, I think it's 97 K.

We're gonna reduce allowances for doubtful account for 400, so that means we can have a higher net accounts receivable and later we reduce more inventory, we write off more inventory and then you know we have less inventory. But I mean. For inventory part. It's like. Doesn't matter, it's higher or lower. I mean maybe that one is not really. It's not a really big deal for our balance sheet, but I mean for the net accounts receivable. We want to have like. Higher rate to collect our money, that means we can make more money. Yeah.
